<h1>Accounting for Electricity Companies</h1>

<h2>Meaning of Public Utility Concern</h2>
<p>The concerns which are engaged in the works of public utility, are called Public Utility Concerns. Meaning of Public Utility is to do the work for the benefit or welfare of the public, as provision for railway services etc. Due to railway facility, persons can go from one place to another easily.<br>
<br>
Such concerns are mostly companies. Their accounts are prepared on the basis of Double Account System.</p>


<h2>Meaning of Double Account System</h2>
<p>There is a special method for preparation of annual accounts of such big companies which are established under special Acts. This method is called Double Account System. This system originated from England. Under this system annual accounts are prepared in such a manner that expenditure incurred on fixed assets and receipts on fixed liabilities are shown in a separate account called ‘Capital Account’ or ‘Receipts and Expenditures on Capital Account’. All other assets and liabilities are shown in a statement called General Balance Sheet.<br>
<br>
According to Kohler double account system is a special system of accounting which is used in public utility companies like Railways, Gas, Water and Electricity Companies etc. Its special feature is to show fixed assets and fixed liabilities separately from floating assets and floating liabilities so that it may become clear that the amount for a particular asset is used for that asset.<br>
<br>
According to Pickles Double Account System is not a special system of accounting. The records in this system are also made according to double entry principles. It is a special system of presenting published accounts of public utility companies.</p>

<h2>Distinction between General Accounting System and Double Account System</h2>

<div style="overflow:auto">

<th>Double Account System</th></tr>

<tr><td>Following are prepared in annual accounts:
<br>(a) Profit & Loss Account

<tr><td>Rent is recorded in Profit and Loss Account.</td>
<td>In case of Railway Company Rent on leased land appear in Net Revenue Account.</td></tr>
</table>
</div>

<h2>Advantages of Double Account System</h2>
<ol>
<li><b>Useful Informations from Capital Account: </b>By preparing Capital Account, balance of capital receipts and capital expenditure can be found out.</li>
<li><b>Assessment of Efficiency:</b> It helps the Government ascertaining that the public utility concern is providing efficient services at a reasonable cost or not.</li>
<li><b>Statistical Returns:</b> It helps in preparation of various statistical returns.</li>
<li><b>Comparison of Floating Items:</b> Comparison of floating assets and floating liabilities becomes easy because they are separately placed in general balance sheet. It is not so in case of ordinary balance sheet.</li>
<li>Easy Replacement of Assets</li>
<li>Current Knowledge of Financial Position</li>
<li>Easy Comparison of Operating and other Items.</li></ol>

<h2>Shortcomings of Double Account System</h2>
<ol>
<li><b>Preliminary Expenses:</b> Preliminary expenses are recorded in capital account.</li>
<li><b>Fixed Assets at Cost:</b> Fixed assets are not shown after deduction of depreciation, hence financial position of the company cannot be correctly assessed, but this criticism has very  little force because a depreciation reserve is created and this reserve appears in the liabilities side of general balance sheet.</li>
<li><b>Difficult to Understand:</b> It is difficult to understand this system. This criticism is true for those who have not studied the special acts under which the concerned company is established.</li>
<li><b>Assets of Small Life:</b> Assets of a small life also appear in the capital account. Even if these assets are reduced to scrap value, they continue to appear in Capital Account.</li>
<li><b>Problem of Repairs and Renewals:</b> Whatever amount is spent on repairs and renewals, it appears in the revenue account of that year in which it is made. Thus in some years no expenditure is charged under this heading while in other years heavy expenditure is charged under this heading and placed in Revenue Account, therefore, correct amount of profit and loss is not found out.</li></ol>

<h2>Accounting Record</h2>
<p>While preparing annual accounts under this system following accounts and statements are made:</p>
<ol><li>Revenue Account</li>
<li>Net Revenue Account</li>
<li>Capital Account.</li>
<li>General Balance Sheet</li></ol>

<h2>Revenue Account</h2>
<p>Revenue Account is prepared like Profit and Loss Account of a trading concern, but entries regarding interest are not made in it as it is done in Profit and Loss Account.</p>

<h2>Net Revenue Account</h2>
<p>Net Revenue Account is prepared in the same manner as Profit and Loss Appropriation Account. Credit balance of revenue account is recorded in the credit side of this account, and debit balance of revenue account appears in the debit side of this account. Interest is recorded in this account.</p>

<h2>Capital Account</h2>
<p>This account is prepared to indicate total capital received from various sources like shares and debentures and application of this capital in acquisition of fixed assets. This amount is divided into two parts. Equity Share Capital, Preference Share Capital, debentures and premium on these capitals appear in the right hand side of this account while all fixed assets appear in the left hand side of this account. This account has eight columns—four columns on the left hand side and four columns on the right hand side.</p>


<h2>General Balance Sheet</h2>
<p>Floating assets and floating liabilities are recorded in general balance sheet. In all the cases, except electricity supply companies, balance of capital account is transferred to general balance sheet. In electricity supply companies totals of capital accounts are transferred to this balance sheet as has been explained earlier. All other rules of preparation of general balance sheet are the same as that of balance sheet of a trading concern.</p>


<hr id="banking-companies">
<h1>Accounting for Banking Companies</h1>

<h2>Meaning of Banking Companies</h2>
<p>The name of Indian Banking Companies Act, 1949 was changed on 1.3.1996 and since then it is known as The Banking Regulation Act, 1949. According to Sec. 5(h) of this Act, ‘Banking’ means the accepting, for the purpose of lending or investment, of deposits of money from the public, repayable on demand or otherwise, and withdrawable by cheque, draft or otherwise. According to Sec. 5(c) of this Act, Banking Company means any company which transacts the business of Banking in India. Bank is an institution which deals in money and credit.<br>
<br>
No company other than a banking company shall use as part of its name any of the words ‘bank’, ‘banker’ or ‘banking’ and no company shall carry on business of banking in India unless it uses as part of its name at least one of such words.<br>
<br>
Fourteen major scheduled banks having aggregate deposits of not less than 50 crores were nationalised on 19th July, 1969. Six more banks were nationalised on 15th April, 1980.</p>

<h2>Functions and Services of a Modern Bank</h2>
<ol>
<li><b>Accepting of Deposits:</b> Bank receives deposits from individuals, firms, associations, societies, companies and corporations etc. These deposits may be fixed, current or saving.
 <ol>
   <li><b>Fixed Deposits:</b> These deposits are repayable after a certain period which mostly varies from one month to seven years or more. Depositors withdraw the amounts of deposit after the expiry of the period for which the deposits are made. They get interest at high rate on these deposits, but if they withdraw the amount before the expiry of the period for which deposit is made, no interest is given to them. They are entitled to take loan on these deposits.</li>
    <li><b>Current Deposits:</b> Under this deposit, customers are allowed to deposit or withdraw amount as and when they like. Interest is not paid by first class banks on these deposits but some banks do allow interest in case the balance of the deposit does not fall below a certain limit. Some banks charge some amount for maintaining these deposits.</li>
    <li><b>Savings Bank Deposit:</b> Under this deposit, customers may deposit money at any time during banking hours but they are allowed to withdraw only once or twice a week and a limit is also placed on the maximum amount which can be withdrawn. Interest allowed on these deposits is less than what is allowed on fixed deposits.</li></ol></li>

<li><b>Giving of Loans:</b> Loans given by banks in India are mostly of the following four types:
  <ol>
    <li><b>Cash Credit:</b> It is an arrangement according to which a customer borrows money upto a certain limit against either certain securities or against a bond of credit by one or more securities. The greatest advantage of this system is that the customers need not borrow at once the whole amount they require, but can draw such amounts as and when required.</li>
    <li><b>Overdraft:</b> A customer is allowed to overdraw more from his current account than what is his credit balance there. This is done only for temporary accommodation. This excess drawings is called ‘overdraft’. Here customer has to pay interest only on that amount which has been actually used by him. Overdraft is usually made against collateral securities. Overdraft facility is made use of occasionally while cash credit is used for long terms.</li>
    <li><b>Loans:</b> When a customer takes an advance in a lumpsum from bank, it is known as a loan. When it is repaid completely or partially, and subsequent accommodation is requested it is treated as a separate transaction.</li>
    <li><b>Discounting of Bill of Exchange:</b> Bank gives loan by discounting bill of exchange. Such loans are for short period and are given on suitable securities.</li></ol></li>

<li><b>Agency Functions:</b> Bank performs various services to its customers as agent. Following are the main functions of a bank:
  <ol>
    <li>To make payment on behalf of customers as per their orders</li>
    <li>To receive amounts on behalf of their customers</li>
    <li>To collect amounts of cheques, bills and Promissory Notes etc. for their customers</li>
    <li>To purchase and sale securities on behalf of customers</li>
    <li>To transfer funds from one place to another</li></ol></li>

<li><b>Issue of Notes:</b> In the past, function of issue of notes was performed by all the banks, but now this work is done only by Reserve Bank of India.</li>

<li>Other Useful Services:
  <ol><li>Safe custody of valuables</li>
  <li>Issue of letters of credit
</li>
  <li>Acceptance of B/E on behalf of the customers</li>
  <li>To collect information and statistics regarding various types of business</li>
  <li>To underwrite the debentures and shares of the companies.</li></ol></ol>

<h2>Accounting Record in the Books of Bank</h2>
<p>In the books of Bank, accounting record is made according to Slip System. Following books are mostly used in Bank accounting:</p>
<ol><li>General Cash Book</li>
<li>Sectional Cash Book</li>
<li>Customers' Receipts Book</li>
<li>Counter Payments Book</li>
<li>Cash Balance Book</li>
<li>Bills Payable Register</li>
<li>Bills Discounting Register</li>
<li>Transfer Journal</li>
<li>General Ledger</li>
<li>Current Account Ledger</li>
<li>Savings Account Ledger</li>
<li>Fixed Deposits Ledger</li>
<li>Investment Ledger</li>
<li>Loan Ledger</li>
<li>Safe Deposits Vault Register</li>
<li>Bill Register</li>
<li>Securities Register</li></ol>

<h2>Slip System</h2>
<p>Double entry system of Book-keeping is adopted in a bank. For accounting, Slip System is very popular in banks. Records in account books are made only on the basis of slips. When a person deposits amount in a bank, he has to fill in pay-in-slip. The concerned officer signs on its counterfoil and returns it back to the person concerned. The portion of pay-in-slip which is retained by the officer is sent to the cashier. Cashier makes record in the cash book on its basis. From cashier this slip is sent to ledger-keeper. There customer's account s credited on the basis of this slip. Ledger-keeper sends this slip to the clerk who makes entries in the Pass Book. This method is also adopted for transferring the amounts from one account to another. Slip system of accounting is also called Unit Media of Posting.</p>

<h2>Amendment of the form set out in Third Schedule</h2>
<p>The Central Government, after giving not less than three months' notice of its intention so to do by a Notification in the Official Gazette may from time to time by a like Notification amend the forms set out in the Third Schedule.</p>

<h2>Audit</h2>
<p>The Balance Sheet and Profit and Loss Account of a banking company shall be audited, by a person duly qualified under any law for the time being in force to be an auditor of a company. Notwithstanding anything contained in any law for the time being in force or in any contact to the contrary, every banking company shall, before appointing, reappointing or removing any auditor or auditors, obtain the previous approval of the Reserve Bank.</p>


<h2>Submission of Returns</h2>
<p>Balance Sheet and Profit and Loss Account together with auditor's report shall be published in prescribed manner and three copies thereof shall be furnished as returns to the Reserve Bank within three months from the end period to which they refer.</p>

<h2>Copies of Balance Sheet and Profit and Loss Account to be sent to Registrar</h2>
<p>A banking company shall, within three months from the end of the period to which they refer, also send to the registrar three copies of Balance Sheet and Profit and Loss Account and of the auditor's report.</p>


<h2>Display of audited Balance Sheet and Profit and Loss Account by companies incorporated outside India</h2>

<h1>Accounting for Insurance Companies</h1>

<h2>Meaning of Insurance</h2>
<p>Insurance is a contract whereby one party, for a consideration which is known as premium, undertakes to indemnify another against a possible loss or to pay a stated sum of money on the happening of a particular event. Risk undertaking party is called ‘Insurer’ and the party for whose sake insurance is effected is called the ‘Insured’, and the document for this contract is known as ‘Policy’.</p>

<h2>Insurance contacts are of various types but following are the main types:</h2>
<ol><li>General Insurance</li>
       <li>Life Insurance</li></ol>
<br>

<p><b>General Insurance:</b> All insurances other than life are regarded as General Insurance. Following insurances are included in general insurance:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Fire Insurance:</b> Under this insurance, in exchange of premium, Insurance Company undertakes to compensate that loss which is caused by fire, but this compensation never exceeds the amount insured.</li>

<li><b>Marine Insurance:</b> Under this Insurance, in exchange of premium, Insurance Company undertakes to compensate loss which is caused by marine risks as per terms of insurance.</li>

<li><b>Accident Insurance Contacts:</b> Under these contacts amount of insurance becomes payable on the happening of insured accident. Insured has to pay premium in this case also like all other cases.</li>

<li><b>Other Insurances:</b> In addition to fire, marine and accident insurance, there are other forms of insurances also, as a musician insures his voice and a dancer insures his or her legs etc.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Important Amendments Made to the Earlier Act by the IRDA Act, 1999</h2>
<p>The main amendments introduced in this Act are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Every insurer must keep separate accounts relating to funds of shareholders and policyholders.</li>

<li>Insurers are prohibited from investing either directly or indirectly their funds outside India.</li>

<li>The Regulatory Authority has the power to direct the insurers to invest funds in infrastructure and social sectors subject to certain conditions.</li>

<li>There is a necessity for insurers to keep a required solvency margin. The margin refers to the excess of assets over liabilities.</li>

<li>Every insurer carrying on general insurance business is required to create a ‘Catastrophe Reserve’ to meet the future potential liability against the insurance policies in force.</li>

<li>It is mandatory for every insurer on or after the commencement of this Act, to prepare a balance sheet, a profit & loss account, a separate receipts and payments account, a revenue account in respect of insurance business transacted by him and in respect of his shareholders' funds.

<hr id="value-added-statements">
<h1>Value Added Statements</h1>

<h2>Meaning of Value Added Statements</h2>
<p>Value Added Statements is a financial statement that depicts wealth created by an organization and how is that wealth distributed among various stakeholders. The various stakeholders comprise of the employees, shareholders, government, creditors and the wealth that is retained in the business.<br>
<br>
Value Added (VA) can provide a useful measure in gauging performance and activity of the reporting entity.<br>
<br>
Disclosure of such information is not required by law or by any accounting standards. It can be voluntarily disclosed by an enterprise. We may compare a farmer, a manufacturer and a trader. Almost the whole of sale value of farmer is value added by it, whereas in case of manufacturer a substantial part is value added by it in case of trader the value addition is very less.</p>

<h2>Important Points</h2>
<ol>
<li>Deferred tax could be shown retained earnings or as a part of 'To pay government'.</li>
<li>Bank overdraft being temporary source of finance, should be considered as the provision of a banking service rather than of capital.</li>
<li>GST should be shown as an application of VA.</li>
<li>Other miscellaneous charges can be taken either as a budget in service items or as application of value added.</li></ol>

<h2>Difference between Value Added and Profit</h2>
<p>Profit subtracts all the cost incurred in the process of generating revenues. The value added, on the other hand only subtracts the cost of bought-in-goods and services. Profits are meant for shareholders whereas value added is meant for stakeholders who include shareholders also. Therefore, value added is a wider term.</p>

<h2>Shortcomings of Value Added Statements</h2>
<ol><li>The concept of showing value added as applied to several interested group is being questioned by many academics. They advocated that since the shareholders are the ultimate risk takers, the residual profit remaining after meeting the obligations of outside interest groups should only be shown as value added accruing to the shareholders.</li>
<li>In no case can the VA statement substitute the traditional income statement (i.e., Profit and loss account).</li>
<li>Such statements are non-standardized for example in areas of inclusion or exclusion of depreciation in the calculation of value added and reporting of taxation (specially excise duty which can be shown as part of bought-in-cost or as application of VA).</li>
</ol>


<hr id="value-chain-analysis">
<h1>Value Chain Analysis</h1>

<h2>Meaning of Value Chain Analysis</h2>
<p>Value chain analysis (VCA) is a process where a firm identifies its primary and support activities that add value to its final product and then analyse these activities to reduce costs or increase differentiation. Value chain represents the internal activities a firm engages in when transforming inputs into outputs.<br>
<br>
Value Chain Analysis describes the activities that take place in a business and relates them to an analysis of the competitive strength of the business. Influential work by Michael Porter suggested that the activities of a business could be grouped under two headings:<br>
<b>(1) Primary Activities:</b> those that are directly concerned with creating and delivering a product (e.g. component assembly); and<br>
<b>(2) Support Activities:</b> which whilst they are not directly involved in production, may increase effectiveness or efficiency (e.g. human resource management). It is rare for a business to undertake all primary and support activities.<br>
<br>
Value Chain Analysis is one way of identifying which activities are best undertaken by a business and which are best provided by others ("out sourced").</p>

<h2>Linking Value Chain Analysis to Competitive Advantage</h2>
<p>What activities a business undertakes is directly linked to achieving competitive advantage. For example, a business which wishes to outperform its competitors through differentiating itself through higher quality will have to perform its value chain activities better than the opposition. By contrast, a strategy based on seeking cost leadership will require a reduction in the costs associated with the value chain activities, or a reduction in the total amount of resources used.</p>

<h2>Steps in Value Chain Analysis</h2>
<p>Value chain analysis can be broken down into a three sequential steps:</p>
<ol><li>Break down a market/organisation into its key activities under each of the major headings in the model;</li>
<li>Assess the potential for adding value via cost advantage or differentiation, or identify current activities where a business appears to be at a competitive disadvantage;</li>
<li>Determine strategies built around focusing on activities where competitive advantage can be sustained.</li></ol>

<h2>Advantages of Value Chain Analysis</h2>
<ol>
<li>Improves quality by providing better understanding of customer requirements when products are assembled from multiple input sources (e.g. cars, computers...).</li>
<li>Provides a way to evaluate competitive cost position and thereby improving strategic positioning.</li>
<li>Reduces time when there is a great deal of interdependency between the participants in a value chain.</li>
<li>Reduce cost by focusing attention on areas needing cost reduction and by reconfiguring the value chain.</li></ol>

<h2>Shortcomings of Value Chain Analysis</h2>
<p>There are several shortcomings when using VC analysis in relation to cost effective management as given below:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Incorrect allocation of cost within the chain:</b> Certain costs are extremely difficult to allocate to certain individual products, but they are the costs of activities which are very significant in relation to total quality and in turn competitive advantage.</li>
<li><b>Long and time-consuming process:</b> If the total philosophy of value chain is not adopted, there is risk of overlooking strategic aspects in decision making. This exercise needs to be repeated again and again looking at competition, both in the present and in the future.</li>
<li><b>Non availability of information regarding competition, product lines and structure:</b> The whole exercise of developing a value chain in practice may be very difficult as the information required is very seldom available.</li>
<li><b>Depends on lots of assumptions or supposition:</b> Another problem inherent when using VC analysis is that management accountant has to make lot of assumptions or suppositions because of non-availability of information. These may be correct.</li></ol>

<h2>How to Improve the Value Chain?</h2>
<p>When a firm takes into account its value chain, it needs to consider its value proposition, or what sets it apart from its competitors. Value chain analysis is designed to improve profits by creating a product or service that is so superior that customers are willing to pay more than the cost to develop it.<br>
<br>
But improving a value chain for the sake of improvement should not be the end goal. Instead, a company should decide why it wants to improve its value chain in the context of its competitive advantage to differentiate itself among its peers.<br>
<br>
Two common competitive advantage strategies include low cost provider or specialization/differentiation of product or service.<p>
<ol>
<li><b>Low-cost provider:</b> value chain analysis focuses on costs and how a company can reduce those costs.</li>
<li><b>Specialization:</b> value chain analysis focuses on the activities that create a unique product or differentiation in service.</li></ol>
<p>Thus, there are two different approaches on how to perform the analysis, which depend on what type of competitive advantage a company wants to create (cost or differentiation advantage). The table below lists all the steps needed to achieve cost or differentiation advantage using VCA.</p>

<h2>Types of Competitive Advantages</h2>
<table>
<tr><th>Cost Advantage</th>
<th>Differentiation Advantage</th></tr>

<tr><td>This approach is used when organizations try to compete on costs and want to understand the sources of their cost advantage or disadvantage and what factors drive those costs.</td>
<td>The firms that strive to create superior products or services use differentiation advantage approach.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Step 1. Identify the firm’s primary and support activities.<br>
Step 2. Establish the relative importance of each activity in the total cost of the product.<br>
Step 3. Identify cost drivers for each activity.<br>
Step 4. Identify links between activities.<br>
Step 5. Identify opportunities for reducing costs.</td>
<td>Step 1. Identify the customers’ value-creating activities.<br>
Step 2. Evaluate the differentiation strategies for improving customer value.<br>
Step 3. Identify the best sustainable differentiation.</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Steps of Cost Advantage</h2>
<p>To gain cost advantage a firm has to go through 5 analysis steps:<br>
<b>Step 1. Identify the firm’s primary and support activities:</b> All the activities (from receiving and storing materials to marketing, selling and after sales support) that are undertaken to produce goods or services have to be clearly identified and separated from each other. This requires an adequate knowledge of company’s operations because value chain activities are not organized in the same way as the company itself. The managers who identify value chain activities have to look into how work is done to deliver customer value.<br>
<br>
<b>Step 2. Establish the relative importance of each activity in the total cost of the product:</b> The total costs of producing a product or service must be broken down and assigned to each activity. Activity based costing is used to calculate costs for each process. Activities that are the major sources of cost or done inefficiently (when benchmarked against competitors) must be addressed first.<br>
<br>
<b>Step 3. Identify cost drivers for each activity:</b> Only by understanding what factors drive the costs, managers can focus on improving them. Costs for labour-intensive activities will be driven by work hours, work speed, wage rate, etc. Different activities will have different cost drivers.<br>
<br>
<b>Step 4. Identify links between activities:</b> Reduction of costs in one activity may lead to further cost reductions in subsequent activities. For example, fewer components in the product design may lead to less faulty parts and lower service costs. Therefore, identifying the links between activities will lead to better understanding how cost improvements would affect the whole value chain. Sometimes, cost reductions in one activity lead to higher costs for other activities.<br>
<br>
<b>Step 5. Identify opportunities for reducing costs:</b> When the company knows its inefficient activities and cost drivers, it can plan on how to improve them. Too high wage rates can be dealt with by increasing production speed, outsourcing jobs to low wage countries or installing more automated processes.</p>

<h2>Steps of Differentiation Advantages</h2>
<p>VCA is done differently when a firm competes on differentiation rather than costs. This is because the source of differentiation advantage comes from creating superior products, adding more features and satisfying varying customer needs, which results in higher cost structure.<br>
<b>Step 1. Identify the customers’ value-creating activities:</b> After identifying all value chain activities, managers have to focus on those activities that contribute the most to creating customer value. For example, Apple products’ success mainly comes not from great product features (other companies have high-quality offerings too) but from successful marketing activities.<br>
<br>
<b>Step 2. Evaluate the differentiation strategies for improving customer value:</b> Managers can use the following strategies to increase product differentiation and customer value:</p>
<ol><li>Add more product features;</li>
<li>Focus on customer service and responsiveness;</li>
<li>Increase customization;</li>
<li>Offer complementary products.</li></ol><br>
<b>Step 3. Identify the best sustainable differentiation:</b> Usually, superior differentiation and customer value will be the result of many interrelated activities and strategies used. The best combination of them should be used to pursue sustainable differentiation advantage.</p>

<h1>Human Resource Accounting</h1>

<h2>Meaning of Human Resource Accounting</h2>
<p>Human Resource Accounting involves accounting for the company's management and employees as human capital that provides future benefits. In the HRA approach, expenditures related to human resources are reported as assets on the balance sheet as opposed to the traditional accounting approach which treats costs related to a company's human resources as expenses on the income statement that reduce profit.</p>

<h2>Definition of Human Resource Accounting</h2>

<p>“HRA is a process of identifying and measuring data about human resources and communicating this information to interested parties.”<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; — American Accounting Association<br>
<br>
“HRA is a measurement and quantification of human organizational inputs such as recruiting, training, experience and commitment.”<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; — Stephen Knauf </p>


<h2>Objective of HRA </h2>
<p>Rensis Likert described the following objectives of HRA:</p>
<ol>
<li>Providing cost value information about acquiring developing, allocating and maintaining human resources.</li>
<li>To monitor effectively the use of human resources by the management.</li>
<li>Finding depreciation or appreciation among human resources and assisting in developing effective management practices.</li>
<li>Increasing managerial awareness of the value of human resources.</li>
<li>For better decisions about people, based on improved information system.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Need for HRA</h2>
<ol>
<li>Under conventional accounting, no information is made available about the human resources employed in an organization, and without people the financial and physical resources cannot be operationally effective.</li>
<li>The expenses related to the human organization are charged to current revenue instead of being treated as investments, to be amortized over a period of time, with the results that magnitude of net income is significantly distorted. This makes the assessment of firm and inter-firm comparison difficult.</li>
<li>The productivity and profitability of a firm largely depends on the contribution of human assets. Two firms having identical physical assets and operating in the same market may have different returns due to differences in human assets. If the value of human assets is ignored, the total valuation of the firm becomes difficult.</li>
<li>If the value of human resources is not duly reported in profit and loss account and balance sheet, the important act of management on human assets cannot be perceived.</li>
<li>Expenses on recruitment, training etc. are treated as expenses and written off against revenue under conventional accounting. All expenses on human resources are to be treated as investments, since the benefits are accrued over a period of time.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Benefits of HRA </h2>
<p>There are certain benefits for accounting of human resources, which are explained as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The system of HRA discloses the value of human resources, which helps in proper interpretation of return on capital employed.</li>
<li>Managerial decision-making can be improved with the help of HRA.</li>
<li>The implementation of human resource accounting clearly identifies human resources as valuable assets, which helps in preventing misuse of human resources by the supervisors as well as the management.</li>
<li> It helps in efficient utilization of human resources and understanding the evil effects of labour unrest on the quality of human resources.</li>
<li>This system can increase productivity because the human talent, devotion and skills are considered valuable assets, which can boost the morale of the employees.</li></ol>

<h2>Shortcomings of HRA </h2>
<p>HRA is yet to gain momentum in India due to certain difficulties:</p>
<ol>
<li>In spite of all its significance and necessity, tax laws do not recognize human being as assets.</li>
<li>The valuation methods have certain disadvantages as well as advantages; therefore, there is always a bone of contention among the firms that which method is an ideal one.</li>
<li>There are no standardized procedures developed so far. So, firms are providing only as additional information.</li>
<li>Under conventional accounting, certain standards are accepted commonly, which is not possible under this method.</li>
<li>All the methods of accounting for human assets are based on certain assumptions, which can go wrong at any time. For example, it is assumed that all workers continue to work with the same organization till retirement, which is far from possible.</li></ol>

<h2>HRA in India</h2>
<p>As far as the statutory requirements go, the Companies Act, 2013 does not demand furnishing of HRA related information in the financial statements of the companies. There are a few organizations, however, that do recognize the value of their human resources, and furnish the related information in their annual reports. In India, some of these companies are: Infosys, Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (BHEL), the Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL), the Minerals and Metals Trading Corporation of India Ltd (MMTC), the Southern Petrochemicals Industries Corporation of India (SPIC), the Associated Cement Companies Ltd, Madras Refineries Ltd, the Hindustan Zinc Ltd, Engineers India Ltd, the Oil and Natural Gas Commission, Oil India Ltd,  the Cement Corporation of India Ltd. etc.</p>


<h2>Methods of Measuring Human Resource Accounting</h2>
<p>Measuring worth of human resource is very difficult, as this requires proper knowledge and experience. Many researches had worked in this area and had formulated various methods to calculate human worth.<br>
The two main methods of measuring HR accounting are:</p>
<ol><li>Cost Approach</li>
       <li>Economic Value Approach</li></ol>

<h2>Cost Approach</h2>
<p>The cost approach involves methods based on  the cost incurred by the company, with regard to an employee. Let us first understand what is cost? Cost is a sacrifice incurred to obtain some anticipated benefits or service. All costs have two portions, i.e., the expense and the assets portions. The expenses portion which provides benefits during the current accounting period while the asset portion is that which is expected to give rise to benefits in the future.<br>
<br>
In Human Resource Accounting two types of costs holds very special importance. These are historical cost and replacement cost.<br>
<br>
The historical cost of human resources is the sacrifice that wad made to acquire and develop the resource. These include the costs of recruitment, selection, hiring, placement, orientation and on-the-job training.<br>
<br>
The replacement cost of human resources is the cost that would have to be incurred if present employees are to be replaced. For instance, if an employee were to leave today, several costs of recruiting, selection, hiring, training would have to be incurred in order to replace him. Such coats have two dimensions: <br>
     (i) Positional replacement cost<br>
     (ii) Personal replacement cost<br>
<br>
Positional replacement cost is the cost to replace the services rendered by an employee only to a particular position. Personal replacement cost is the cost to replace all the services expected to be rendered by the employee at the various positions that he might have occupied during his work-life in the organisation.</p>

<h2>Economic Value Approach</h2>
<p>The value of an object, in economic terms, is the present value of the services that it is expected to render in future. Similarly, the economic value of human resource is the present worth of the service that they are likely to render in the future. This may be the value of individuals, groups or the total human organisation. The methods for calculating the economic value of individuals may be classified into monetary and non-monetary methods.</p>


<hr id="human-resource-audit">
<h1>Human Resource Audit</h1>

<h2>Meaning of Human Resource Audit</h2>
<p>Human resource audit refers to an examination and evaluation of policies, procedures and practices to determine the effectiveness and efficiency of human resource management.<br>
Human resource audit has two aspects:</p>
<ol>
<li>The measurement of the effectiveness of the mission objectives, strategies, policies, procedures, programmes and activities of human resource management.</li>
<li>The determination of what should or should not be done in the future as a result of such measurement.</li></ol>
<p>HR Audit facilitates control of human resource by revealing important facts such as absenteeism, employee turnover, grievance, etc.</p>

<h2>Need for HR Audit</h2>
<p>Organizations conduct HR audit due to following reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Even though small organizations may not need formal HR audit, as the organisations grow the need for such audit increases. As a continuous feedback it is necessary to improve the performance of employees HR audit can only make it possible.</li>
<li>As employees' unions have become stronger and employment policy decided by bilateral negotiations between union and managements, managerial competence come under criticism. This has made it necessary to conduct HR audit.</li>
<li>Rapidly rising employees' wages and salaries resulting in higher labour costs and increased opportunity for competitive advantage in managing human resource has compelled management to conduct HR audit.</li></ol>


<h2>Auditing Process</h2>
<p>Auditing process differs from organisation to organisation, but some essential steps are described below:</p>
<ol><li>Briefing and orientation</li>
<li>Scanning material information</li>
<li>Conducting employee's survey</li>
<li>Conducting interview</li>
<li>Analysis of data</li>
<li>Reporting</li></ol>
<br>
<ol>
<li><b>Briefing and Orientation:</b> This is a preparatory meeting of key staff members to:
  <ol>
  <li>discuss particular issues considered to be significant,</li>
  <li>chart out audit procedures, and</li>
  <li>develop plans and programmes of audit.</li>
  </ol>
</li>

<li><b>Scanning Material Information:</b> This involves scanning of all available records and documents pertaining to the personnel as well as personnel hand-books and manuals, guides, appraisal forms, material on recruitment, computer capabilities, and all such other information considered relevant.</li>

<li><b>Conducting Employee's Survey:</b> Surveying employees involves interview with key managers, functional executives, top functionaries in the organisations and even employees' representatives, if necessary. The purpose is to identify and enumerate issue of concern, present strength, anticipated needs and managerial philosophies on human resources.</li>

<li><b>Conducting Interview:</b> The key issue for interview is to list the pertinent and probing questions. The decision on these questions depends on the scope and purpose of audit as well as on the culture of the organisations. The skill of the interviewer lies in getting relevant and correct information without threatening the interviewers.</li>

<li><b>Analysis of Data:</b> The data thus gathered is synthesized to present the:
  <ol>
  <li>Current situation</li>
  <li>Priorities</li>
  <li>Staff pattern</li>
  <li>Issues identified</li></ol>
Here, future needs are identified and appropriate criteria developed for spotlighting the human resource priorities and specific recommendations made.</li>

<li><b>Reporting:</b> Based on the findings and discussions during the meetings, then a final report is prepared and presented formally to the management. This report should include the 'state of organisation' report, the assessment of effectiveness and efficiency of various areas covered by the audit, a legal compliance/areas of concern report, and critical recommendations for improvement.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Scope of HR Audit</h2>
<p>The HR audit usually covers three parameters namely:</p>
<ol><li>HR policies and practices</li>
<li>HR professionals</li>
<li>HR departments</li></ol>
<br>
<p>With respect to each of these, the audit tries to find out:</p>
<ol><li>The actual state.</li>
<li>The congruence between the standard state and the actual state.</li>
<li>The alignment with the overall organizational strategy and goals.</li>
<li>The compliance with the laws and regulations.</li></ol>

<h2>Frequency of HR Audit</h2>
<p>Human resource audit differs in case of different organisations depending upon:</p>
<ol><li>The basic purpose of Audit.</li>
<li>The frequency of changes in strategies, policies and personnel within the organisation.</li>
<li>The rapidity of technological changes which are expected to impact the psychology of people.</li>
<li>The periodicity of changes in the external business environment. The faster the change in environment the higher frequency of HR audit.</li>
<li>The speed of change in legal, socio-economic and political conditions.</li></ol>

<h2>Shortcomings of HR Audit</h2>
<p>Human resource audit has following shortcomings:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is not developed fully regarding its scope and content.</li>
<li>HR audit has no sound basis of well-defined principles and practices.</li>
<li>Lack of qualified HR auditors may create a problem.</li>
<li>The auditing process may have the elements of subjectivity. The skills, knowledge and the experience of the management auditor largely determines the success of HR audit.</li>
<li>HR audit is based on interviews, questionnaire methods which has its own limitations, i.e., of communication business, etc.
HR audit can be used as a technique of organisational development.</li></ol>



<hr id="brand-accounting">
<h1>Brand Accounting</h1>
<h2>Meaning of Brand Accounting</h2>
<p>The term brand accounting refers to the practice of valuation and reporting of the value of brand of a product or service in the financial statements of a corporate entity, the value of a brand being ascertained either as a result of revaluation in the case of home-grown brands or as a result of acquisition/merger in the case of newly acquired brands.<br>
<br>
Accounting is basically a measurement and communication system. Corporate brand accounting can be defined as a process of identification, measurement and communication of brand value and brand equity to permit informed judgment and decisions by the users of the information.<br>
<br>
It is a system designed to determine the brand value with a view to reflect the brands as assets in the corporate balance sheet. However, brand accounting goes beyond valuation of corporate brand. It is the process of total brand management through accounting information.</p>

<h2>Objectives of Brand Accounting</h2>
<p>The accounting for brands is motivated by the following reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Real Economic Value:</b> By showing brand value in the Balance Sheet of a firm, an objective and realistic assessment of the company’s real economic value could be made possible. This would facilitate the ascertainment of correct Net Asset Value (NAV) which would be useful in times of business acquisitions and mergers.</li>

<li><b>Future Profitability:</b> A brand generated or purchased, could be very useful for ascertaining the future income making ability of companies. In fact, enormous sums of money spent on promoting and supporting brands would go to appreciate the value of the firm. Companies which enjoy brand equity will have the market value of their share enhanced. Brand equity refers to the value added to the equity of a firm by the brand popularity and loyalty.</li>

<li><b>Preventing Predation:</b> By building and explicitly disclosing brands in financial statements, companies could put up a powerful defense against potential predators and thereby ward off possible acquisition and take-over bids.</li>

<li><b>Leverage Benefits:</b> By enhancing the NAVs through brand disclosure separately in the Balance sheet, it is possible for companies to resort to easy debt borrowings as this causes an increase in NAV. In fact, the borrowing limits a firm enhances with the increase in NAV. This ultimately paves the way for sound capital structure and an improved gearing ratio.</li>

<li><b>Quality Decisions:</b> Inclusion of brand values not only enhances NAV, ensure fair valuation of the firm. This promotes quality managerial decision making. Brand valuation may help managers in placing importance on brand promotion and strategic brand positioning which hold the key for corporate marketing success.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Shortcomings in Brand Accounting</h2>
<p>Intangibles are not easily measurable and it poses severe challenges in valuation of brands also. Some of the shortcomings faced by the accountants in brand valuation are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Distinctiveness:</b> Brands need to be valued distinctively as different from other intangibles such as Goodwill etc. For instance, any attempt to commonly treat brand as a part of Goodwill as is done at present may create serious distortions in accounting position. Besides, this would create handicaps in brand accounting. This is because, a brand cannot be treated like any other item such as patents and copyrights. In fact, a brand needs to be separately disclosed in the Balance sheet, because of its significant contribution to corporate image and identity.</li>

<li><b>Disclosure:</b> There is always a problem of making disclosure of brand values in financial statements. This is because, there is no standard accounting practice requiring statement and disclosure of brand values in a particular way.</li>

<li><b>Uncertainty:</b> The problem that is associated with the brand, as an item of intangibles, is that its possible returns are uncertain, immeasurable and non-current in nature. Any expected on such intangibles are usually either written off or treated as Deferred Revenue Expenditure.</li>

<li><b>New Brands:</b> A related problem, in accounting for such intangibles as brands is that it is often difficult to determine whether a new one is being gradually substituted for an existing brand. This raises the issue as to how to account for it in subsequent years. In such case, the relevant question is: Should the original cost of brand be written-down as it erodes? It may be difficult to determine whether a brand remains the same asset overtime as it is subtly reshaped to meet new market opportunities.</li>

<li><b>Joint Costs:</b> The contribution to the value of a brand is made not simply by investing a desirable product with a customer seductive name, but by building market share by the skilful exploitation of the product in a whole host of ways of general efficiency with which a business is conducted by expending money on a joint cost basis. It is very difficult to segregate and account for joint costs that are incurred and the cost of brand developed as a result of general operations of the business.</li>

<h1 class="t-center">Unit 3</h1>

<hr id="social-responsibility-accounting">
<h1>Social Responsibility Accounting</h1>

<h2>Meaning of Corporate Social Responsibility</h2>
<p>Corporate social responsibility is the continuing commitment by business to behave ethically and contribute to economic development while improving the quality of life of the workforce and their families as well as of the local community and society at large.<br>
<br>
CSR is closely linked with the principles of sustainable development, which argues that enterprises should make decisions based not only on financial factors such as profits or dividends, but also based on the immediate and long-term social and environmental consequences of their activities.</p>

<h2>Meaning of Social Accounting</h2>
<p>Social accounting is rational assessment of and reporting on some meaningful, definable domain of a business enterprise’s activities that have social impact. This aims at measuring (either in monetary or non-monetary units) adverse and beneficial effects of such activities both on the firm and/or those affected by the firm. Being concerned with the social, human and environment constraints on organisational behaviour it measures social costs and benefits. The social accounting information is communicated to social groups both within and outside the firm. Thus, social accounting implies the measurement and reporting, internal or external, of information concerning the impact of a business enterprise and its activities on society.</p>

<h2>Meaning of Socio-economic Accounting</h2>
<p>Socio-economic accounting results from the application of accounting in the social sciences; it refers to the ordering, measuring, analysis, and disclosure of the social and economic consequences of governmental and entrepreneurial behaviour. It includes these activities at the macro and micro level. At the micro level, its purpose is the measurement and reporting of the impact of organisational behaviour of firms on their environment. At the macro level, its purpose is the measurement and disclosure of the economic and social performance of the nation. At the micro level, socio-economic accounting includes, therefore, financial and managerial social accounting and reporting and social auditing. At the macro level, socio-economic accounting includes, therefore, social measurement, social accounting and reporting, and the role of accounting in economic development.</p>

<h2>Users of Social Responsibility Information</h2>
<p>Social responsibility information about business enterprises is mainly useful to internal users (management), external users (shareholders and other investors), and in influencing the share prices of a company.</p>

<h2>Internal Users</h2>
<p>Within a company, the greatest need and the greatest demand for social responsibility information comes from top management, or board of directors. Top management, especially the chief executive officer, needs social performance information to respond to a critical press, to answer shareholders’ questions, and to ensure that company policies are followed. Corporate directors, especially because of their growing legal liability, need to know in some detail what sort of social programmes the company is having, and what result it is getting. Directors also need complete information about the effect of the company on society, it is probably more important that they be fully informed as to negative effects, since this is where the criticism will be directed and this is where the directors may have to defend themselves. Labour unions can also be expected to seek social performance information about their companies.</p>

<h2>External Users</h2>
<p>The external users’ demand for social responsibility information is even more diverse. Social accounting and reporting are needed by present and potential investors, by large institutions and individuals. Some studies conducted in this area show the impact of social disclosure on investment decisions.</p>

<h2>Benefits of Social Responsibility Reporting</h2>
<ol>
<li>Increased transparency</li>
<li>Informed and accurate decision making</li>
<li>Better risk and crisis management</li>
<li>Enhanced brand value and reputation</li>
<li>Good relations with Government and communities</li>
<li>Long term sustainability for the company and society as more criticism and suggested improvements are received from internal and external auditors.</li>
<li>Ensured CSR implementation as Governments monitor standard compliance.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Scope of Social Responsibility Accounting</h2>
<p>Brummet has identified five possible areas in which corporate social objectives may be found:</p>
<ol><li>Net income contribution</li>
<li>Human resource contribution</li>
<li>Public contribution</li>
<li>Environmental contribution</li>
<li>Product or service contribution</li>
</ol>

<p>The term ‘contribution’ includes both benefits and costs associated with an organisation’s activities. Implicit in this definition of the scope of corporate social responsibility are a variety of users having different purposes in using accounting information.</p>

<h2>1. Net Income Contribution</h2>
<p>The growing attention which other social objectives are receiving does not reduce the importance of the income objective. A business organisation cannot survive without an adequate financial surplus; long-range planning includes calculating the minimum return to shareholders. The recognition of the importance of other social objectives does not diminish the importance of the income objectives. On the contrary, it adds meaning to the significance of corporate net income by drawing attention to the circumstances under which it has been produced. In this sense, there is a clear correlation between income and other objectives. The failure to recognise a social responsibility may well affect the organisation’s income performance either in the short term or the long-term. Thus, excessive hours of work under bad working conditions may damage the ability of workers to maintain the level of output. Failure to pay adequate attention to the quality of the products and customer’s reactions to poor product quality may ultimately affect sales and income.</p>

<h2>2. Human Resource Contribution</h2>
<p>This contribution reflects the impact of organisational activities on the people who constitute the human resources of the organisation. These activities include; recruiting practices; training programmes; experience building, job rotation; job enrichment; wage and salary levels; fringe benefit plans; management union relations; employee skills; employee knowledge; employee attitudes; employee self-actualisation; congruence of employee and organisational goals; mutual trust and confidence; job security, stability of work force, lay-off and recall practices; transfer and promotion policies; occupational health; freedom from undue stress; on-the-job physical environment, and on-the-job safety.</p>

<h2>3. Public Contribution</h2>
<p>This area considers the impact of organisational activities on individuals generally outside the organisation. For example, general philanthropy contributions to educational, cultural, or charitable organisations; financial or manpower support for public transportation; health services, urban housing, daycare centers, minority business, community problem solving, minority group programmes and general volunteer community activities; equal opportunity employment practices; training and employment of handicapped persons; and taxes paid.<br>
<br>
The contribution which corporate enterprise may make towards the public good are generally overlooked in the debate on social accounting. It should be noted, for example, that the creation of jobs and the provision of employment are important public contributions, as well as the development of local services which often accompanies corporate expansion into a community. The training and employment of the handicapped is an important corporate social contribution.</p>

<h2>4. Environmental Contribution</h2>
<p>This area involves the environmental aspects of production, covering the use of resources, the production process and the product itself, including recycling and other positive environmental activities. Attention has been drawn in recent years to the negative aspects of organisational activities such as the pollution of air and water, noise, and spoiling of the environment. Moreover, industrial activities lead to a net use of irreplaceable resources and a net production solid wastes.<br>
<br>
Corporate social objectives are to be found in the abatement of these negative external social effects of industrial production, and in adopting more efficient technologies to minimise the use of irreplaceable resources and the production of waste.</p>

<h2>5. Product or Service Contribution</h2>
<p>This area concerns the qualitative aspects of the organisation’s product or service, for example, product utility, product life-durability, product safety serviceability as well as the welfare role of the product or service. Moreover, it includes customer satisfaction, truthfulness in advertising, completeness and clarity of labelling and packaging. Many of these considerations are important already from a marketing point of view. It is clear, however, that the social responsibility aspect of the product contribution extends beyond what is advantageous from a marketing angle.</p>


<hr id="environmental-accounts">
<h1>Environmental Accounts</h1>

<h2>Meaning of Environmental Accounting</h2>
<p>Environmental Accounting is a faithful attempt to identify and bring to light the resources consumed and the costs rendered reciprocally to the environment by a business enterprise.<br>
It is a method of recording environmental elements and includes:</p>
<ol><li>valuation of natural resources,</li>
<li>measuring the income therefrom,</li>
<li>keeping records of the related costs,</li>
<li>estimating their quantities and providing 
depreciation on them.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Need and significance of Environmental 
Accounting.</h2>
<ol>
<li><b>Resource Utilisation:</b> Natural Resources (water, air, minerals, forests etc.) are required to carry on the business activities of every firm. Also, the functioning of an enterprise has some favourable and some adverse effects on the environment. Hence, there is a need for maintaining accounts of the effects of the activities of a business entity on the environment and on natural resources.</li>

<li><b>Resource Availability:</b> Environmental Accounting is useful for disclosing how much natural resources are available in the country, their incomes and the costs incurred to use them and their depreciation, values etc.</li>

<li><b>Social Responsibility:</b> Environmental Accounting is helpful for measuring industrial development and social welfare and the fulfilment of social responsibilities by Companies. Companies are urged to be accountable to both Shareholders and wider society. Profit Making is not considered as the sole corporate objective.</li>

<li><b>Qualitative Study:</b> Traditional Accounting System is restricted to quantitative and monetary aspects only. Hence, Environmental Accounting is necessary to analyse the effect of environmental resources in the entire business functions of a firm.</li>

<li><b>Environmental Protection:</b> Environmental Accounting will help in evaluating the problem of environment protection. The business activities of the enterprise should be recognised as society (environment) centred and not only profit-centred.</li>

<li><b>Going Concern:</b> Environmental pollution and the substantial costs associated with clean-up activities, fines, compensation, and bad publicity etc. can even significantly affect the share prices and even the stability of a Company. Hence, environmental accounting awareness is required.</li>

<li><b>Social Accounting:</b> Social Accounting has been the precursor of Environmental Accounting. Social Costs also include the use of natural resources and pollution of environments. Also preservation of the environment is a critical factor for sustainable development. So, Environmental Accounting deserves special attention of manager, investors, society, different branches of Government and other stakeholders.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Areas of Environmental Accounting</h2>
<h3>National Level Environmental Accounting</h3>
<ol><li>This denotes modification of National Income accounts to include environmental aspects.</li>
<li>This provides only a macro viewpoint of the environmental aspects of development.</li></ol>

<h3>Corporate Environmental Reporting</h3>
<ol><li>This denotes Voluntary and Involuntary disclosures by Corporate Entities on the impact of its activities on environment.</li>
<li>This provides Corporate Environmental Accounting and may also include Social Cost Benefit Analysis of projects affecting environment.</li></ol>

<h2>National Level Environmental Accounting</h2>
<ol><li>National Level Environmental Accounting, denotes a set of aggregate national data linking the environment to the economy which will have a long-term impact on the economic and environmental policy making.</li>
<li>This requires necessary amendments to the System of National Accounts (SNA) to incorporate the use or depletion of national resources. SNA is a set of accounts which every national Government compiles routinely to track the activities of the economy.</li>
<li>SNA data are used to calculate major economic indicators including GDP, GNP, Savings Rate and Balance Of Trade figures. The accounts are prepared by all countries in a standardised form, using a framework developed by the United Nations Statistical Division. It helps international comparison and thus allows to place individual countries in the context of world trends.</li></ol>

<h2>Drawbacks of National Level Environmental 
Accounting</h2>
<p>In its present format, the SNA does not include full economic value of environmental resources. SNA has to be amended in view of the following problems with the present system of national accounts.</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Non-recognition of Environmental Expenditure:</b> Expenditure to protect the environment from damage or to mitigate the environmental degradation cannot be identified and segregated from the SNA data.</li>
<li><b>Non-marketed Goods and Services:</b> The environment provides certain goods which are not sold but which are of high value e.g. fuel-wood and building materials generated in forests, medicinal plants etc. However, some countries do not include these in their annual income accounts, estimating total consumption and then using market prices of comparable products as an alternative method to calculate the value of non-marketed goods and services.</li>
<li><b>Consumption of Natural Capital:</b> The SNA treats gradual depletion of Physical Capital (plant and machinery etc.) as depreciation rather than income. However, the depletion of Natural Capital, forests in particular is accounted as income. Most experts of environmental accounting agree that depletion of natural capital should be accounted for in the same manner as in case of other physical assets.</li></ol>

<h2>Aspects covered in Corporate Environmental Accounting system</h2>
<p>Environmental Accounting System should include aspects such as:</p>
<ol><li>Concept of National Income arising out of the use of Natural Resources;</li>
<li>Concept of Costs incurred to make use of such Resources;</li>
<li>Depreciation of Natural Resources;</li>
<li>Valuation of Natural Resources;</li>
<li>Disclosing the value of Natural Resources in the Balance Sheet;</li>
<li>Contribution of Natural Resources to Industrial Development;</li>
<li>Contribution of Industries to the Environment; and</li>
<li>Extent to which changes in the environment due to business activities has affected social well-being.</li></ol>

<h2>Environmental Reporting can be classified into two parts</h2>
<p><b>(a) Management Note/Discussion in Director’s Report:</b> Broad Environment Protection Policy adopted and pursued by the Company and material proceedings under environmental laws should be disclosed here.<br>
<b>(b) Accounting Treatment and Reporting:</b> Financial effect of environmental protection measures on capital expenditures and earnings should be covered in the Notes forming part of Financial Statements.</p>

<h2>Reporting Requirements of Environmental Accounting</h2>
<p>Under a comprehensive Corporate Accounting Framework on environmental issues the Board of Directors in their Report or Management Discussions should disclose the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Type of environmental issues that are pertinent to the enterprise and its industry;</li>
<li>Policy and programmes that have been adopted by the Company with respect to Environmental Protection Measures; or where there is no policy or programmes, such fact should be disclosed;</li>
<li>Improvements made by the Company in key areas, since the introduction of the policy, or over the past five years, whichever is shorter;</li>
<li>Environmental Emission Targets that the Company has set for itself, and how the Company is performing relative to those targets;</li>
<li>Extent to which Environmental Protection Measures have been undertaken as per Government Legislation, and the extent to which Government Requirements (e.g. time table for reduction of emissions) are achieved;</li>
<li>Where any material proceedings under environmental laws have been taken, a disclosure of the known and potentially significant environmental problem shall be disclosed, unless it can be objectively concluded that the problem is not likely to occur, or if it does, the effect is not likely to be material;</li>
<li>Financial or Operational Effect of Environmental Protection Measures on the Capital Expenditure and Earnings of the Enterprise for the current period and any specific impact on future periods;</li>
<li>Actual Amount charged to operations in the current period, together with a description of the relative environmental measures.</li>
<li>Sub-classification of the above actual amounts into the following :
     <ol><li>Liquid Effluent Treatment;</li>
  <li>Waste Gas and Air Treatment;</li>
  <li>Solid Waste Treatment;</li>
  <li>Analysis Control and Compliance;</li>
  <li>Remediation;</li>
  <li>Recycling; and</li>
  <li>Others (e.g. accidents, safety, etc.).</li></ol>
Where it is not possible to segregate the amount that relates to Environmental Protection Measures, disclosure of such fact is essential.</li>
<li>When material, the actual amount capitalised during the current period, the accumulated amount capitalised to date, and the period for amortising, or writing off, such amounts, together with a description of the environmental measures to which they relate. This amount might be sub-divided into categories stated above. Where it is not possible to segregate the amount that relates to environmental measures, this fact could be stated.</li></ol>

<h2>Disclosure of environment-related Accounting Policies.</h2>
<p>The following environment-related Accounting Policies may be disclosed in the Notes to Accounts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Recording Liabilities and Provisions;</li>
<li>Setting up of Catastrophe Reserves (though appropriations of retained earnings);</li>
<li>Disclosure of Contingent Liabilities.</li></ol>
<br>
<p>The following environment-related items could be included in Contingent Liabilities, if material:</p>
<ol><li>Liabilities, Provisions and Reserves that have been set / made for the current period, and amounts accumulated to date,</li>
<li>Contingent Liabilities, with an estimate of the amount involved, unless the event is not likely to occur. Also, the possible loss could be quantified to the extent reasonably practicable. If the possible loss cannot be reasonably calculated, a description of the Contingent Liability could be given along with the reason why an estimate of the amount of the loss cannot be made. Completion of a feasibility study of remediation costs may be normally considered as the earliest date at which a reasonable estimate of the liability is possible.</li></ol>

<h2>Major issues in Environment Accounting.</h2>
<p>Major Accounting Issues in Environmental Accounting are: </p>
<ol>
<li><b>Environmental Expenditure vs. Normal Business Expenditure:</b> Many machines may have state-of-the-art environmental technology. Hence, a portion of such capital costs and also the running and maintenance expenditure may be treated as environment related expenditure. There should be proper guidelines for allocating the capital and revenue expenditures between Environmental Expenditure and Normal Business Expenditure.</li>
<li><b>Capitalisation vs. Charging Off of Environmental Expenditure:</b> Environmental protection costs relating to prior periods and current period are generally very high. If these are expensed off in one year, EPS may be adversely affected. Some Companies may capitalise such expenditure and amortise the same over say 10 years. Uniformity is required for comparative analysis of Financial Statements.</li>
<li><b>Recognition of Environment related Contingent Liabilities:</b> Environmental Contingent Liabilities are a matter of increasing concern. Recognizing a liability for hazardous waste remediation frequently depends on the ability to estimate remediation costs reasonably. Developing a reliable estimate requires evaluation of technological, regulatory and legal factors, each of which calls for exercise of management judgement to reach a supportable accounting conclusions.</li></ol>

<h1>Lease Accounting</h1>

<h2>Meaning of Leasing</h2>
<p>Leasing involves a contractual relationship in which the owner (lessor) of an asset or property grants to a person/firm (lessee) the use of the asset's services for a specified period of time for an agreed sum of rent. Leasing therefore, enables a person/firm to avail the services of plant and machinery or equipment or land and building without making the investment or incurring debt obligation.<br>
For this kind of services, the person/firm can pay a series of periodic amounts called ‘lease rentals’ or ‘lease payments’ to the owner of the asset at predetermined rates. Such payments may be made monthly, quarterly or annually.</p>

<h2>Meaning of Lease</h2>
<p>Lease is an aggrement by which the lessor gives the right to use an asset for given period of time to the lessee on rent.<br>
It involves two parties, a lessor and a lessee and an asset which is to be leased. The lessor, who owns the asset, agrees to allow to the lessee to use it for a specified period of time in return for periodic rent payments.<br>
The lease transactions derive its accounting complexity from number of alternatives available to the parties involved. Lease can be structured to take tax benefit. It can be used to transfer ownership of the leased asset, and it can also be used to transfer the risk of ownership.<br>
In any event substance of transactions dictates the accounting treatment; the lease transaction (finance lease) is probably the best example of the accounting profession's substance over legal form.<br>
If the transactions effectively transfer ownership to lease, then the substance of the transactions is that of a sale and should be recognized as such even though transactions take form of a lease.</p>

<h2>Type of Lease</h2>
<p>As per Accounting Standard-19, the lease can be classified as:
<ol><li>Financial Lease</li>
<li>Operating Lease</li></ol>
</p>

<h2>1. Financial Lease</h2>
<p>A financial lease is a lease in which all the risks incidental to the ownership of the assets and rewards or benefits is transferred to the lessee, except the title which may or may not eventually be transferred. Finance lease ia also called as capital lease. Leasing under this type of contract is irrevocable or non-cancellable. Lessor is mere a financier and not interested in the asset. The lessor can recover his capital outlays and a reasonable return on his investment in the asset during the term of lease. The cost towards insurance, taxes, repairs and maintenance are borne by the lessee.</p>

<h2>Criteria for Financial Lease</h2>
<p>A question arises as what are the criteria which would lead to a lease being classified as financial lease. AS-19 provides certain criteria which would normally lead to a lease being classified as a financial lease. These are:
<ol>
<li>Lessor transfers ownership of the asset to the lessee by the end of lease term.</li>
<li>Lessee has the option to purchase the asset at a price which is expected to be quite lower than the fair value at the date, the option becomes exercisable such that at the time of inception of the lease, it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised.</li>
<li>Lease-term is for major part of the economic life of the asset, even if the title is not transferred.</li>
<li>At the inception of the lease the present value (calculated by using the appropriate discounting rate) of Minimum Lease Payments (MLP) amounts to at least substantially all of the fair value of the leased asset.</li>
<li>The leased asset is of such a specialised nature that only the lessee can use it without major modifications being made.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h2>2. Operating Lease</h2>
<p>As per AS-19, operating lease which does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incident to ownership. In other words, a lease other than a financial lease is an operating lease. The operating lease have the following features:
<ol>
<li>The lease can be cancelled by the lessor before the expiry period.</li>
<li>The responsibility for providing maintenance and repairs, insurance and services lies with the lessor.</li>
<li>The rental paid by the lessee may not be necessarily sufficient to cover the asset's cost.</li>
<li>The lease period is of a shorter duration.</li>
<li>The asset is returned to the lessor after the expiry of the lease period who can sell the asset to recover the cost of asset.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h2>Distinction between Financial Lease and Operating Lease</h2>
<table>
<tr><th>Financial Lease</th>
<th>Operating Lease</th></tr>

<tr><td>The leased asset is use specific. The lessor generally purchases the asset identified and lease out to lessee.</td>
<td>The leased based asset is of common use activity. The lessor already has the possession of the asset and leases it out to several users successively.</td></tr>

<tr><td>The lease period is longer i.e., usually related to the useful life of the asset.</td>
<td>The operating lease is usually of a shorter duration and have no relation with the economic life of the asset.</td></tr>

<tr><td>The risks and rewards incidental to ownership are passed on to the lessee. The lessor only remains the legal owner of the asset.</td>
<td>The lessee obtains the right to use the asset. However, the ownership, benefits and risks associated with the assets remains with the lessor.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Lessee is responsible for maintenance, insurance and taxes, etc.</td>
<td>Lessor is responsible for maintenance, insurance and taxes, etc.</td></tr>

<tr><td>The lease can not be cancelled initially within 3 or 5 or 8 years.</td>

<td>The lease is usually cancellable at short notice.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>The capital expenditure made by the lessor is fully amortised during the primary lease period. The amount received as lease rental includes the capital outlay, interest and profit.</td>
<td>The capital expenditure made by the lessor is not fully amortised during the single lease period.</td></tr>

<tr><td>The lessor plays a role of financier. Lessor is a financial institution and he can not provide specialised service in regards to asset.</td>
<td>The lessor is specialised in handling and operating the asset and is capable of providing specialised services.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Financial lease is generally suitable for equipment which is tailor made and does not have ready resale or re-lease market.</td>
<td>This type of lease is suitable for equipment which has longer economic life and have ready resale or re-lease market, i.e., automobiles, computers, office equipments.</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>3. Sale and Leaseback</h2>
<p>In this type of lease, the owner of an asset sells that asset to the lessor and then gets the asset back on lease from the lessor. The purpose of the leaseback is to free up the original owner's capital while allowing the owner to retain possession and use of the property.<br>
<br>
A sale and leaseback can be beneficial to both the buyer as well as the seller. The seller gets a lumpsum of cash quickly which improves the liquidity. And the lessor gets the benefit in terms of tax credit and a flow of regular income.<br>
<br>
The sale and leaseback aggrement is popular among companies which are facing short-term liquidity crisis. Oil and Natural Gas Commission (ONGC), undertook an international ‘sale and leaseback’ aggrement with 10 Japanese lessors, led by Sumisho Leasing for an equipment owned by the ONGC, aggregating $60 million. The payment terms were fixed at a rate of 10.5% with the amount payable in 14 equal semi-annual installments, following a grace period of 6 years, so that the aggregate lease tenor extended to 13 years. The ONGC simultaneously swapped the fixed-rate borrowing with a floating-interest rate so that the cost of funds was reduced to 60 basis points below Libor.</p>

<h2>4. Leverage Leasing</h4>
<p>Under leveraged-leasing aggrement, a third party is involved besides the lessor and the lessee. The lessor borrows a part of the purchase cost (say 80%) of the asset from the third party, that is, the lender and the asset so purchased is held as a security against the loan. The lender is paid off from the lease rentals directly by the lessee and the surplus after meeting the claims of the  lender goes to the lessor. The lessor, the owner of the asset, is entitled to a depreciation allowance, associated with the asset.</p>

<h2>5. Close- and Open-ended Lease</h2>
<p>In a close-ended lease, the asset gets transferred to the lessor, at the end of the lease-contract period, where as in an open-ended lease, the lessee has the option of purchasing the asset.</p>

<h2>6. Upfront and Back-end Lease</h2>
<p>In an upfront lease, higher lease rentals are charged in the initial years and lower rentals in the later years of contract. Where as in the back-end lease, in the initial years, the lease rentals are less but increase in the later years.</p>

<h2>7. Percentage Lease</h2>
<p>In the percentage lease, the lessor needs to pay fix-lease rentals plus some percentage of the previous year's gross revenue.</p>

<h2>8. 3N Lease (Net and Net-net Leases)</h2>
<p>In the Net and Net-net leases, the lessee is responsible for maintenance, insurance and taxes of the property.</p>

<h2>9. Cross-border Lease</h2>
<p>In the cross-border or international lease, the lessee and the lessor are situated in two different countries.</p>

<h2>Contents of Lease Contract</h2>
<ol><li>The period of lease.</li>
<li>The amount and time of payment to be paid by the lessee.</li>
<li>Provision for payment of tax, insurance, repairs and maintenance.</li>
<li>Renewal of lease or purchase of assets on the expiration of lease.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Advantages of Leasing</h2>
<p>The advantages of leasing are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Leasing agreement provides acquisition of fixed assets without outlaying any capital expenditure and the period of lease and rent can be changed or fixed by mutual agreement.</li>
<li>Leasing aggrement provides the lessee an opportunity to use its internal resources for financing and other activities.</li>
<li>Lease provides tax benefit deduction to lessee and leasing does not effect the maximum borrowing limits.</li>
<li>Leasing aggrement does not affect the financial position of the company as it does not form a part of liabilities or assets to be shown in Balance Sheet.</li>
<li>Leasing is considered as an additional source of finance and does not involve any cost in raising capital.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Shortcomings of Leasing</h2>
<p>The shortcomings of leasing are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Leasing aggrement provides the payment of rent immediately after entering the aggrement i.e., even before the cash being generated from those activities.</li>
<li>Leasing may restrict certain tax incentives/benefits which are being provided by the tax authorities for new projects.</li>
<li>The rent and interest rates can be changed under various clauses of lease agreement which may become burden for lessee after few years of lease.</li>
<li>The lessee can not terminate the contract except by paying penalties which may be very heavier.</li>
<li>The lessee can review the lease after the expiry of the term only if he has the right to do so.</li>

<h1>Accounting for Financial Instruments</h1>

<h2>Meaning of Financial Instruments</h2>
<p>A financial instruments is a legally enforceable aggrement between two or more parties expressing contractual rights to the payment of money. It is a contractual right of one person to the aggrement and contractual liability of another person to the aggrement, consequently it will be the financial asset for the person who has right to receive the money and financial liability for the person who has obligation to pay money. Thus the financial instrument includes financial asset as well as financial liability. This is the reason why these accounting standards on financial instruments are not merely relevant to financial entities but equally to non-financial entities.<br>
<br>
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a ‘financial asset’ of one entity and a ‘financial liability’ or equity instrument of another entity.</p>

<h2>Financial Asset</h2>
<p>Any asset that is:</p>
<ol><li>Cash;</li>
<li>An equity instrument of another entity;</li>
<li>A contractual right:
  <ol><li>To receive cash or another financial asset from another entity; or</li>
  <li>To exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another entity under conditions those are potentially favourable to the entity.</li>
  </ol></li>
<li>A contract that will or may be settled in the entity's own equity instruments that is:
  <ol><li>A non-derivative for which the entity is or may be obliged to receive a variable number of the entity's own equity instrument; or</li>
  <li>A derivative that will or may be settled other than by the exchange of a fixed amount of cash or another financial asset for a fixed number of the entity's own equity instruments.</li>
  </ol></li>
</ol>

<h2>Common examples of financial assets:</h2>
<p>Representing a contractual right to receive cash in the future are:</p>
<ol><li>Trade accounts receivable</li>
<li>Notes receivable</li>
<li>Loans receivable and</li>
<li>Bonds receivable</li>
</ol>

<h2>Assets which are not a financial assets:</h2>
<ol><li>Physical assets such as inventories, property, plant and equipment;
</li>
<li>Leased assets;</li>
<li>Intangible assets such as patents and trademarks are not financial assets;</li>
<li>Prepaid expenses;</li>
<li>Income tax refund.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Financial Liability</h2>
<p>Any liability that is a contractual obligation to:</p>
<ol><li>Deliver cash or another financial asset to another entity; or</li>
<li>Exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another entity under conditions that are potentially favourable to the entity.</li></ol>

<h2>Examples of financial liability:</h2>
<ol><li>Trade payable - Contractual obligation to pay cash</li>
<li>Bank loans - Contractual obligation to pay cash</li>
<li>Finance lease obligation</li>
<li>Operating lease rent payable</li>
<li>Debentures and Bonds payable</li>
<li>Financial guarantee</li>
<li>Financial derivatives</li>
<li>Redeemable preference share capital</li>
</ol>

<h2>Examples of items which are not financial liability:</h2>
<ol><li>Income tax payable</li>
<li>Excise duty payable</li>
<li>VAT payable</li>
<li>Provision for warranty obligation - To be settled by providing goods or services and not by cash</li>
<li>Advances from customers - To be settled by providing goods or services</li>
<li>Minority interest</li>
<li>Non-financial contact</li>
<li>Non-financial derivative's contact</li></ol>

<h2>Redeemable Preference Share</h2>
<p>The substance of a financial instrument, rather than its legal form, governs its classification in the entity's Balance Sheet. Substance and legal form are commonly consistent, but not always. Some financial instruments take the legal form of equity but are liabilities in substance and others may combine features associated with equity instruments and features associated with financial liabilities.</p>

<h2>Puttable Instrument</h2>
<p>A Puttable Instrument is a financial instrument that gives the holder the right to put the instrument back to the issuer for cash or another financial asset or is automatically put back to the issuer on the occurrence of an uncertain future event or the death or retirement of the instrument holder.</p>

<h2>Equity Instrument</h2>
<p>An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. In simple terms, an equity instrument of Company X gives a person a share of the equity of Company X.</p>

<h2>Examples of Equity Instruments</h2>
<ol><li>Non-puttable Ordinary Shares</li>
<li>Puttable Instruments (if not financial liabilities and specific conditions are met)</li>
<li>Instruments imposing obligation to deliver pro-rata share in net assets only on liquidation (if not financial liabilities and specific conditions are met)</li>
<li>Preference Shares (when distribution is at the discretion of the issuer and not mandatory)</li>
<li>Warrants or Written call options.</li></ol>

<h2>Preference shares</h2>
<p>Preference shares may be issued with various rights. In determining whether a preference share is a financial liability or an equity instrument, an issuer assesses the particular rights attaching to the share to determine whether it exhibits the fundamental characteristics of a financial liability.</p>


<h2>Disclosure Requirements for Financial Instruments</h2>
<p>Ind AS-107 prescribes the disclosure requirements for:</p>
<ol><li>Different categories of financial assets</li>
<li>Different categories of financial liabilities</li>
<li>Re-classifications of financial assets</li>
<li>De-recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities</li>
<li>Financial assets pledged or held as collateral</li>
<li>Allowances for credit losses</li>
<li>Compound financial instruments with multiple embedded derivatives</li>
<li>Defaults and breaches for loan payable</li>
<li>Income, expense, gains or losses recognized in profit and loss account</li>
<li>Accounting policies followed</li>
<li>Hedge accounting</li>
<li>Fair value determination for financial assets and financial liabilities</li>
<li>Risk disclosures.</li></ol>

<h2>Types of Financial Assets</h2>
<p>The financial assets may be of three types:</p>
<ol><li>Debt Instrument</li>
<li>Equity Instrument</li>
<li>Derivatives</li></ol>

<h2>Classification of Financial Liabilities</h2>
<p>A financial liability is classified into two categories as under:</p>
<ol><li>Financial liabilities at amortized cost</li>
<li>Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)</li></ol>


<hr id="stock-options">
<h1>Stock Options</h1>

<h2>Meaning of Stock Options</h2>
<p>A stock option is a financial instrument that allows the option handler the right to buy or sell shares of a certain stock at a specified price for a specified period of time.<br>
<br>
Stock options are traded on exchanges much like the stocks (Apple, ExxonMobil, etc.) themselves. The price of the option itself can be higher or lower than the original price when it was first listed. Most listed options in the U.S. conform to an options calendar and typically expire on the third friday of the month in which they are set to expire. Prior to this expiration date,  the option holder has to decide whether to exercise the option by buying or selling the number of shares associated with the option, selling the option, or simply letting it expire.</p>

<h2>Here are a few key terms associated with options:</h2>
<ol><li>A call option allows the option holder the right to purchase the stock at a set price within a set time.</li>
<li>A put option allows the buyer the option to sell shares of the stock at a set price within a set period of time.</li>
<li>The strike price is the price at which the option can be exercised.</li>
<li>A premium is the amount the buyer of the option pays for the option. It represents the maximum profit the seller of the option can realize.</li></ol>

<h2>How do Stock Options work?</h2>
<p>The price of a listed option is tied to the price movement of the underlying stock. If the price of the stock rises or falls, the option will generally move in the same direction.</p>

<h2>Employee Stock Options (ESOs)</h2>
<p>In addition to listed stock options, a number of companies offer employee stock options as a form of incentive compensation. Employee stock options offer the employee the right to purchase a set number of shares at a specified price for a fixed period of time.</p>


<hr id="eps">
<h1>Earnings Per Share (EPS)</h1>

<h2>Meaning of Earnings Per Share (EPS)</h2>
<p>Earnings per share are the net earnings of the company earned on one share. It is an important and widely used metric which audited financial reports of the companies also particularly mentions in most countries. In other words, it expresses the earning capacity of the company, if divided by the value of one share. We commonly call it return on equity. Higher the EPS, the better is the performance and prospects of the company. The track record of EPS for several years reflects the growth rate of the company and potential investors look forward to investing in the company if they see an increasing trend.</p>


<h2>Formula for Calculating Earnings per Share</h2>
<p>The equation or formula used for earnings per share ratio is as follows:</p>


<img src="img-eps.jpg" alt="eps">

Earnings Per Share = 

Profits / Earnings after Taxes (EAT) Less Preference Share Dividend

___________________________________

Number of Equity Shares Outstanding


<p>We commonly call it ‘return on equity’. The track record of EPS for several years reflect the growth rate of the company and potential investors look forward to investing in the company if they see an increasing trend.</p>


<hr id="reporting">
<h1>Reporting</h1>

<h2>Meaning of Financial Reporting</h2>
<p>Financial reporting may be defined as communication of published financial statements and related information from a business enterprise to third parties (external users) including shareholders, creditors, customers, governmental authorities and the public. It is the reporting of accounting information of an entity (individual, firm, company, government enterprise) to a user or group of users. Company financial reporting is a total communication system involving the company as issuer (preparer); the investors and creditors as primary users, other external users; the accounting profession as measures and auditors; and the company law regulatory or administrative authorities.</p>

<h2>Objectives of Financial Reporting</h2>
<p>The following may be described as the primary objectives of financial reporting:</p>
<ol><li>Investment Decision-making</li>
<li>Management Accountability</li></ol>

<h2>Investment Decision-making</h2>
<p>The basic objective of financial reporting is to provide information useful to investors, creditors and other users in making sound investment decisions. These decisions concern the efficient allocation of investment funds and the selection among investment opportunities.</p>

<h2>Management Accountability</h2>
<p>A second basic objective of financial reporting is to provide information on management accountability to judge management's effectiveness in utilising the resources and running the enterprise. Management of an enterprise is periodically accountable to the owners not only for the custody and safekeeping of enterprise resources, but also for their efficient and profitable use and for protecting them to the extent possible from unfavourable economic impacts of factors in the economy such as technological changes, inflation or deflation.</p>

<h1>Securitization of Assets</h1>

<h2>Meaning of Securitization</h2>
<p>Securitization is a carefully structured process by which a pool of loans and other receivables are packaged and sold in the form of asset-backed securities to the investors to raise the required funds from them. Through this process relatively illiquid assets are converted into securities. Securitization falls under the broad category termed as structured finance transactions.<br>
<br>
In a securitized transaction, the burden of repayment on the bond shifts away from the issuer to a pool of assets or to a third party. The cash flows from the pools of assets which have been securitized provide the funds for repayment to the bond.<br>
<br>
Securitization is said to have taken place when a company’s assets are removed in one way or the other form from its balance sheet and are funded instead by investors. The investors receive tradable financial instruments evidencing the investment without recourse to lending institution. The entire transaction, from the accounting point of view, is carried out on the asset side of the balance sheet, that is, one asset gets converted into another.</p>

<h2>Mechanism of Securitization</h2>
<p>Typically, the mechanism of securitization is outlined below:</p>
<ol>
<li>The process of securitization starts with identification by the company (the originator) the loans or bills receivable in its portfolio, to prepare a basket or pool of assets to be securitized. The package usually forms an optimum mix so as to ensure fair marketability of the instrument to be issued.</li>

<li>The pool of assets so identified is then sold to a specific purpose vehicle (SPV) or trust. Usually an investment banker performs the task of an SPV, which is also called an issuer, as it ultimately issues the securities to investors.</li>

<li>Once the assets are acquired by SPV, the same are split into individual shares/securities which are reimbursed by selling them to investors. These securities are called ‘Pay or Pass Through Certificates’ (PTC) which are so structured as to synchronize for redemption with the maturity of the securitized loans or bills.<br>
<br>
A PTC thus represents a sale of an undivided interest to the extent of the face value of the PTC in the aggregate pool of assets acquired by the SPV from the originator.</li>

<li>Repayments under the securitized loans or bills keep on being received by the originator and passed on to the SPV. To this end, the contractual relationship between the originator an d the borrowers/obligates is allowed to subsist in terms of the pass through transaction; alternatively a separate agency arrangement is made between the SPV (Principal) and the originator (agent).</li>

<li>Although a PTC could be with recourse to its originator, the usual practice has been to make it without recourse. Accordingly, a PTC holder takes recourse to the SPV and not the originator for payment to the principal and interest on the PTCs held by him. However, a part of the credit risk, as perceived (and not interest risk), can be absorbed by the originator, by transferring the assets at a discount, enabling the SPV to issue the PTCs at a discount to face value.</li>

<li>The debt to be securitized and the PTC issues are got rated by rating agencies on the eve of the securitization. The issues by the SPV could also be guaranteed by external guarantor-institutions to enhance creditability of the issues. The PTCs, before maturity, are tradable in a secondary market to ensure liquidity for the investors.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<p>From the above, it is evident that the primary participants involved in the issuance of securitization transaction are the originator, obligors, the SPV, the servicer and the credit enhancer. The originator has the assets which are sold or used as collateral for the assets backed securities. Originators are generally manufacturing companies, financial institutions, banks and non-banking finance companies.</p>

<h2>Utility of Securitization</h2>
<p>Securitization as a financial instrument is becoming extremely popular the world over with more and more issuers resorting to raising funds through this route. This is for this fact that it confers lot of benefits on the parties to the process.<br>
<br>
Securitization serves as handmade to organization in raising additional funds to finance their growth programme. Companies with poor credit standing and therefore finding it difficult to procure resources from the market can obtain funds by issuing asset back securities at lower interest cost due to higher credit rating on such securities. Even if the issuer is not an AAA rated company, it can issue an AAA rated securitized asset.<br>
<br>
Further, cost of raising funds by way of securitization is cheaper than that involved in funding by way of conventional fund-raising instruments like shares, bonds, debentures, and commercial papers.<br>
<br>
Securitization also facilitates strengthening of capital adequacy of the originating company by isolating the loan-assets from the originator’s balance sheet and by removing or replacing them. Securitization is equally useful to investors. It offers multiple new investment instruments for mutual funds, insurance companies, pension funds and general investors to cater to their needs and preferences. Besides widening the choice and availability, it also provides for higher return and liquidity for the instrument.</p>
