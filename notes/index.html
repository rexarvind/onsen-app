<h1>Value Added Statements</h1>

<h2>Meaning of Value Added Statements</h2>
<p>Value Added Statements is a financial statement that depicts wealth created by an organization and how is that wealth distributed among various stakeholders. The various stakeholders comprise of the employees, shareholders, government, creditors and the wealth that is retained in the business.<br>
<br>
Value Added (VA) can provide a useful measure in gauging performance and activity of the reporting entity.<br>
<br>
Disclosure of such information is not required by law or by any accounting standards. It can be voluntarily disclosed by an enterprise. We may compare a farmer, a manufacturer and a trader. Almost the whole of sale value of farmer is value added by it, whereas in case of manufacturer a substantial part is value added by it in case of trader the value addition is very less.</p>

<h2>Important Points</h2>
<ol>
<li>Deferred tax could be shown retained earnings or as a part of 'To pay government'.</li>
<li>Bank overdraft being temporary source of finance, should be considered as the provision of a banking service rather than of capital.</li>
<li>GST should be shown as an application of VA.</li>
<li>Other miscellaneous charges can be taken either as a budget in service items or as application of value added.</li></ol>

<h2>Difference between Value Added and Profit</h2>
<p>Profit subtracts all the cost incurred in the process of generating revenues. The value added, on the other hand only subtracts the cost of bought-in-goods and services. Profits are meant for shareholders whereas value added is meant for stakeholders who include shareholders also. Therefore, value added is a wider term.</p>

<h2>Shortcomings of Value Added Statements</h2>
<ol><li>The concept of showing value added as applied to several interested group is being questioned by many academics. They advocated that since the shareholders are the ultimate risk takers, the residual profit remaining after meeting the obligations of outside interest groups should only be shown as value added accruing to the shareholders.</li>
<li>In no case can the VA statement substitute the traditional income statement (i.e., Profit and loss account).</li>
<li>Such statements are non-standardized for example in areas of inclusion or exclusion of depreciation in the calculation of value added and reporting of taxation (specially excise duty which can be shown as part of bought-in-cost or as application of VA).</li>
</ol>


<hr id="value-chain-analysis">
<h1>Value Chain Analysis</h1>

<h2>Meaning of Value Chain Analysis</h2>
<p>Value chain analysis (VCA) is a process where a firm identifies its primary and support activities that add value to its final product and then analyse these activities to reduce costs or increase differentiation. Value chain represents the internal activities a firm engages in when transforming inputs into outputs.<br>
<br>
Value Chain Analysis describes the activities that take place in a business and relates them to an analysis of the competitive strength of the business. Influential work by Michael Porter suggested that the activities of a business could be grouped under two headings:<br>
<b>(1) Primary Activities:</b> those that are directly concerned with creating and delivering a product (e.g. component assembly); and<br>
<b>(2) Support Activities:</b> which whilst they are not directly involved in production, may increase effectiveness or efficiency (e.g. human resource management). It is rare for a business to undertake all primary and support activities.<br>
<br>
Value Chain Analysis is one way of identifying which activities are best undertaken by a business and which are best provided by others ("out sourced").</p>

<h2>Linking Value Chain Analysis to Competitive Advantage</h2>
<p>What activities a business undertakes is directly linked to achieving competitive advantage. For example, a business which wishes to outperform its competitors through differentiating itself through higher quality will have to perform its value chain activities better than the opposition. By contrast, a strategy based on seeking cost leadership will require a reduction in the costs associated with the value chain activities, or a reduction in the total amount of resources used.</p>

<h2>Steps in Value Chain Analysis</h2>
<p>Value chain analysis can be broken down into a three sequential steps:</p>
<ol><li>Break down a market/organisation into its key activities under each of the major headings in the model;</li>
<li>Assess the potential for adding value via cost advantage or differentiation, or identify current activities where a business appears to be at a competitive disadvantage;</li>
<li>Determine strategies built around focusing on activities where competitive advantage can be sustained.</li></ol>

<h2>Advantages of Value Chain Analysis</h2>
<ol>
<li>Improves quality by providing better understanding of customer requirements when products are assembled from multiple input sources (e.g. cars, computers...).</li>
<li>Provides a way to evaluate competitive cost position and thereby improving strategic positioning.</li>
<li>Reduces time when there is a great deal of interdependency between the participants in a value chain.</li>
<li>Reduce cost by focusing attention on areas needing cost reduction and by reconfiguring the value chain.</li></ol>

<h2>Shortcomings of Value Chain Analysis</h2>
<p>There are several shortcomings when using VC analysis in relation to cost effective management as given below:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Incorrect allocation of cost within the chain:</b> Certain costs are extremely difficult to allocate to certain individual products, but they are the costs of activities which are very significant in relation to total quality and in turn competitive advantage.</li>
<li><b>Long and time-consuming process:</b> If the total philosophy of value chain is not adopted, there is risk of overlooking strategic aspects in decision making. This exercise needs to be repeated again and again looking at competition, both in the present and in the future.</li>
<li><b>Non availability of information regarding competition, product lines and structure:</b> The whole exercise of developing a value chain in practice may be very difficult as the information required is very seldom available.</li>
<li><b>Depends on lots of assumptions or supposition:</b> Another problem inherent when using VC analysis is that management accountant has to make lot of assumptions or suppositions because of non-availability of information. These may be correct.</li></ol>

<h2>How to Improve the Value Chain?</h2>
<p>When a firm takes into account its value chain, it needs to consider its value proposition, or what sets it apart from its competitors. Value chain analysis is designed to improve profits by creating a product or service that is so superior that customers are willing to pay more than the cost to develop it.<br>
<br>
But improving a value chain for the sake of improvement should not be the end goal. Instead, a company should decide why it wants to improve its value chain in the context of its competitive advantage to differentiate itself among its peers.<br>
<br>
Two common competitive advantage strategies include low cost provider or specialization/differentiation of product or service.<p>
<ol>
<li><b>Low-cost provider:</b> value chain analysis focuses on costs and how a company can reduce those costs.</li>
<li><b>Specialization:</b> value chain analysis focuses on the activities that create a unique product or differentiation in service.</li></ol>
<p>Thus, there are two different approaches on how to perform the analysis, which depend on what type of competitive advantage a company wants to create (cost or differentiation advantage). The table below lists all the steps needed to achieve cost or differentiation advantage using VCA.</p>

<h2>Types of Competitive Advantages</h2>
<table>
<tr><th>Cost Advantage</th>
<th>Differentiation Advantage</th></tr>

<tr><td>This approach is used when organizations try to compete on costs and want to understand the sources of their cost advantage or disadvantage and what factors drive those costs.</td>
<td>The firms that strive to create superior products or services use differentiation advantage approach.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Step 1. Identify the firm’s primary and support activities.<br>
Step 2. Establish the relative importance of each activity in the total cost of the product.<br>
Step 3. Identify cost drivers for each activity.<br>
Step 4. Identify links between activities.<br>
Step 5. Identify opportunities for reducing costs.</td>
<td>Step 1. Identify the customers’ value-creating activities.<br>
Step 2. Evaluate the differentiation strategies for improving customer value.<br>
Step 3. Identify the best sustainable differentiation.</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Steps of Cost Advantage</h2>
<p>To gain cost advantage a firm has to go through 5 analysis steps:<br>
<b>Step 1. Identify the firm’s primary and support activities:</b> All the activities (from receiving and storing materials to marketing, selling and after sales support) that are undertaken to produce goods or services have to be clearly identified and separated from each other. This requires an adequate knowledge of company’s operations because value chain activities are not organized in the same way as the company itself. The managers who identify value chain activities have to look into how work is done to deliver customer value.<br>
<br>
<b>Step 2. Establish the relative importance of each activity in the total cost of the product:</b> The total costs of producing a product or service must be broken down and assigned to each activity. Activity based costing is used to calculate costs for each process. Activities that are the major sources of cost or done inefficiently (when benchmarked against competitors) must be addressed first.<br>
<br>
<b>Step 3. Identify cost drivers for each activity:</b> Only by understanding what factors drive the costs, managers can focus on improving them. Costs for labour-intensive activities will be driven by work hours, work speed, wage rate, etc. Different activities will have different cost drivers.<br>
<br>
<b>Step 4. Identify links between activities:</b> Reduction of costs in one activity may lead to further cost reductions in subsequent activities. For example, fewer components in the product design may lead to less faulty parts and lower service costs. Therefore, identifying the links between activities will lead to better understanding how cost improvements would affect the whole value chain. Sometimes, cost reductions in one activity lead to higher costs for other activities.<br>
<br>
<b>Step 5. Identify opportunities for reducing costs:</b> When the company knows its inefficient activities and cost drivers, it can plan on how to improve them. Too high wage rates can be dealt with by increasing production speed, outsourcing jobs to low wage countries or installing more automated processes.</p>

<h2>Steps of Differentiation Advantages</h2>
<p>VCA is done differently when a firm competes on differentiation rather than costs. This is because the source of differentiation advantage comes from creating superior products, adding more features and satisfying varying customer needs, which results in higher cost structure.<br>
<b>Step 1. Identify the customers’ value-creating activities:</b> After identifying all value chain activities, managers have to focus on those activities that contribute the most to creating customer value. For example, Apple products’ success mainly comes not from great product features (other companies have high-quality offerings too) but from successful marketing activities.<br>
<br>
<b>Step 2. Evaluate the differentiation strategies for improving customer value:</b> Managers can use the following strategies to increase product differentiation and customer value:</p>
<ol><li>Add more product features;</li>
<li>Focus on customer service and responsiveness;</li>
<li>Increase customization;</li>
<li>Offer complementary products.</li></ol><br>
<b>Step 3. Identify the best sustainable differentiation:</b> Usually, superior differentiation and customer value will be the result of many interrelated activities and strategies used. The best combination of them should be used to pursue sustainable differentiation advantage.</p>

<hr id="social-responsibility-accounting">
<h1>Social Responsibility Accounting</h1>

<h2>Meaning of Corporate Social Responsibility</h2>
<p>Corporate social responsibility is the continuing commitment by business to behave ethically and contribute to economic development while improving the quality of life of the workforce and their families as well as of the local community and society at large.<br>
<br>
CSR is closely linked with the principles of sustainable development, which argues that enterprises should make decisions based not only on financial factors such as profits or dividends, but also based on the immediate and long-term social and environmental consequences of their activities.</p>

<h2>Meaning of Social Accounting</h2>
<p>Social accounting is rational assessment of and reporting on some meaningful, definable domain of a business enterprise’s activities that have social impact. This aims at measuring (either in monetary or non-monetary units) adverse and beneficial effects of such activities both on the firm and/or those affected by the firm. Being concerned with the social, human and environment constraints on organisational behaviour it measures social costs and benefits. The social accounting information is communicated to social groups both within and outside the firm. Thus, social accounting implies the measurement and reporting, internal or external, of information concerning the impact of a business enterprise and its activities on society.</p>

<h2>Meaning of Socio-economic Accounting</h2>
<p>Socio-economic accounting results from the application of accounting in the social sciences; it refers to the ordering, measuring, analysis, and disclosure of the social and economic consequences of governmental and entrepreneurial behaviour. It includes these activities at the macro and micro level. At the micro level, its purpose is the measurement and reporting of the impact of organisational behaviour of firms on their environment. At the macro level, its purpose is the measurement and disclosure of the economic and social performance of the nation. At the micro level, socio-economic accounting includes, therefore, financial and managerial social accounting and reporting and social auditing. At the macro level, socio-economic accounting includes, therefore, social measurement, social accounting and reporting, and the role of accounting in economic development.</p>

<h2>Users of Social Responsibility Information</h2>
<p>Social responsibility information about business enterprises is mainly useful to internal users (management), external users (shareholders and other investors), and in influencing the share prices of a company.</p>

<h2>Internal Users</h2>
<p>Within a company, the greatest need and the greatest demand for social responsibility information comes from top management, or board of directors. Top management, especially the chief executive officer, needs social performance information to respond to a critical press, to answer shareholders’ questions, and to ensure that company policies are followed. Corporate directors, especially because of their growing legal liability, need to know in some detail what sort of social programmes the company is having, and what result it is getting. Directors also need complete information about the effect of the company on society, it is probably more important that they be fully informed as to negative effects, since this is where the criticism will be directed and this is where the directors may have to defend themselves. Labour unions can also be expected to seek social performance information about their companies.</p>

<h2>External Users</h2>
<p>The external users’ demand for social responsibility information is even more diverse. Social accounting and reporting are needed by present and potential investors, by large institutions and individuals. Some studies conducted in this area show the impact of social disclosure on investment decisions.</p>

<h2>Benefits of Social Responsibility Reporting</h2>
<ol>
<li>Increased transparency</li>
<li>Informed and accurate decision making</li>
<li>Better risk and crisis management</li>
<li>Enhanced brand value and reputation</li>
<li>Good relations with Government and communities</li>
<li>Long term sustainability for the company and society as more criticism and suggested improvements are received from internal and external auditors.</li>
<li>Ensured CSR implementation as Governments monitor standard compliance.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Scope of Social Responsibility Accounting</h2>
<p>Brummet has identified five possible areas in which corporate social objectives may be found:</p>
<ol><li>Net income contribution</li>
<li>Human resource contribution</li>
<li>Public contribution</li>
<li>Environmental contribution</li>
<li>Product or service contribution</li>
</ol>

<p>The term ‘contribution’ includes both benefits and costs associated with an organisation’s activities. Implicit in this definition of the scope of corporate social responsibility are a variety of users having different purposes in using accounting information.</p>

<h2>1. Net Income Contribution</h2>
<p>The growing attention which other social objectives are receiving does not reduce the importance of the income objective. A business organisation cannot survive without an adequate financial surplus; long-range planning includes calculating the minimum return to shareholders. The recognition of the importance of other social objectives does not diminish the importance of the income objectives. On the contrary, it adds meaning to the significance of corporate net income by drawing attention to the circumstances under which it has been produced. In this sense, there is a clear correlation between income and other objectives. The failure to recognise a social responsibility may well affect the organisation’s income performance either in the short term or the long-term. Thus, excessive hours of work under bad working conditions may damage the ability of workers to maintain the level of output. Failure to pay adequate attention to the quality of the products and customer’s reactions to poor product quality may ultimately affect sales and income.</p>

<h2>2. Human Resource Contribution</h2>
<p>This contribution reflects the impact of organisational activities on the people who constitute the human resources of the organisation. These activities include; recruiting practices; training programmes; experience building, job rotation; job enrichment; wage and salary levels; fringe benefit plans; management union relations; employee skills; employee knowledge; employee attitudes; employee self-actualisation; congruence of employee and organisational goals; mutual trust and confidence; job security, stability of work force, lay-off and recall practices; transfer and promotion policies; occupational health; freedom from undue stress; on-the-job physical environment, and on-the-job safety.</p>

<h2>3. Public Contribution</h2>
<p>This area considers the impact of organisational activities on individuals generally outside the organisation. For example, general philanthropy contributions to educational, cultural, or charitable organisations; financial or manpower support for public transportation; health services, urban housing, daycare centers, minority business, community problem solving, minority group programmes and general volunteer community activities; equal opportunity employment practices; training and employment of handicapped persons; and taxes paid.<br>
<br>
The contribution which corporate enterprise may make towards the public good are generally overlooked in the debate on social accounting. It should be noted, for example, that the creation of jobs and the provision of employment are important public contributions, as well as the development of local services which often accompanies corporate expansion into a community. The training and employment of the handicapped is an important corporate social contribution.</p>

<h2>4. Environmental Contribution</h2>
<p>This area involves the environmental aspects of production, covering the use of resources, the production process and the product itself, including recycling and other positive environmental activities. Attention has been drawn in recent years to the negative aspects of organisational activities such as the pollution of air and water, noise, and spoiling of the environment. Moreover, industrial activities lead to a net use of irreplaceable resources and a net production solid wastes.<br>
<br>
Corporate social objectives are to be found in the abatement of these negative external social effects of industrial production, and in adopting more efficient technologies to minimise the use of irreplaceable resources and the production of waste.</p>

<h2>5. Product or Service Contribution</h2>
<p>This area concerns the qualitative aspects of the organisation’s product or service, for example, product utility, product life-durability, product safety serviceability as well as the welfare role of the product or service. Moreover, it includes customer satisfaction, truthfulness in advertising, completeness and clarity of labelling and packaging. Many of these considerations are important already from a marketing point of view. It is clear, however, that the social responsibility aspect of the product contribution extends beyond what is advantageous from a marketing angle.</p>


<hr id="environmental-accounts">
<h1>Environmental Accounts</h1>

<h2>Meaning of Environmental Accounting</h2>
<p>Environmental Accounting is a faithful attempt to identify and bring to light the resources consumed and the costs rendered reciprocally to the environment by a business enterprise.<br>
It is a method of recording environmental elements and includes:</p>
<ol><li>valuation of natural resources,</li>
<li>measuring the income therefrom,</li>
<li>keeping records of the related costs,</li>
<li>estimating their quantities and providing 
depreciation on them.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Need and significance of Environmental 
Accounting.</h2>
<ol>
<li><b>Resource Utilisation:</b> Natural Resources (water, air, minerals, forests etc.) are required to carry on the business activities of every firm. Also, the functioning of an enterprise has some favourable and some adverse effects on the environment. Hence, there is a need for maintaining accounts of the effects of the activities of a business entity on the environment and on natural resources.</li>

<li><b>Resource Availability:</b> Environmental Accounting is useful for disclosing how much natural resources are available in the country, their incomes and the costs incurred to use them and their depreciation, values etc.</li>

<li><b>Social Responsibility:</b> Environmental Accounting is helpful for measuring industrial development and social welfare and the fulfilment of social responsibilities by Companies. Companies are urged to be accountable to both Shareholders and wider society. Profit Making is not considered as the sole corporate objective.</li>

<li><b>Qualitative Study:</b> Traditional Accounting System is restricted to quantitative and monetary aspects only. Hence, Environmental Accounting is necessary to analyse the effect of environmental resources in the entire business functions of a firm.</li>

<li><b>Environmental Protection:</b> Environmental Accounting will help in evaluating the problem of environment protection. The business activities of the enterprise should be recognised as society (environment) centred and not only profit-centred.</li>

<li><b>Going Concern:</b> Environmental pollution and the substantial costs associated with clean-up activities, fines, compensation, and bad publicity etc. can even significantly affect the share prices and even the stability of a Company. Hence, environmental accounting awareness is required.</li>

<li><b>Social Accounting:</b> Social Accounting has been the precursor of Environmental Accounting. Social Costs also include the use of natural resources and pollution of environments. Also preservation of the environment is a critical factor for sustainable development. So, Environmental Accounting deserves special attention of manager, investors, society, different branches of Government and other stakeholders.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Areas of Environmental Accounting</h2>
<h3>National Level Environmental Accounting</h3>
<ol><li>This denotes modification of National Income accounts to include environmental aspects.</li>
<li>This provides only a macro viewpoint of the environmental aspects of development.</li></ol>

<h3>Corporate Environmental Reporting</h3>
<ol><li>This denotes Voluntary and Involuntary disclosures by Corporate Entities on the impact of its activities on environment.</li>
<li>This provides Corporate Environmental Accounting and may also include Social Cost Benefit Analysis of projects affecting environment.</li></ol>

<h2>National Level Environmental Accounting</h2>
<ol><li>National Level Environmental Accounting, denotes a set of aggregate national data linking the environment to the economy which will have a long-term impact on the economic and environmental policy making.</li>
<li>This requires necessary amendments to the System of National Accounts (SNA) to incorporate the use or depletion of national resources. SNA is a set of accounts which every national Government compiles routinely to track the activities of the economy.</li>
<li>SNA data are used to calculate major economic indicators including GDP, GNP, Savings Rate and Balance Of Trade figures. The accounts are prepared by all countries in a standardised form, using a framework developed by the United Nations Statistical Division. It helps international comparison and thus allows to place individual countries in the context of world trends.</li></ol>

<h2>Drawbacks of National Level Environmental 
Accounting</h2>
<p>In its present format, the SNA does not include full economic value of environmental resources. SNA has to be amended in view of the following problems with the present system of national accounts.</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Non-recognition of Environmental Expenditure:</b> Expenditure to protect the environment from damage or to mitigate the environmental degradation cannot be identified and segregated from the SNA data.</li>
<li><b>Non-marketed Goods and Services:</b> The environment provides certain goods which are not sold but which are of high value e.g. fuel-wood and building materials generated in forests, medicinal plants etc. However, some countries do not include these in their annual income accounts, estimating total consumption and then using market prices of comparable products as an alternative method to calculate the value of non-marketed goods and services.</li>
<li><b>Consumption of Natural Capital:</b> The SNA treats gradual depletion of Physical Capital (plant and machinery etc.) as depreciation rather than income. However, the depletion of Natural Capital, forests in particular is accounted as income. Most experts of environmental accounting agree that depletion of natural capital should be accounted for in the same manner as in case of other physical assets.</li></ol>

<h2>Aspects covered in Corporate Environmental Accounting system</h2>
<p>Environmental Accounting System should include aspects such as:</p>
<ol><li>Concept of National Income arising out of the use of Natural Resources;</li>
<li>Concept of Costs incurred to make use of such Resources;</li>
<li>Depreciation of Natural Resources;</li>
<li>Valuation of Natural Resources;</li>
<li>Disclosing the value of Natural Resources in the Balance Sheet;</li>
<li>Contribution of Natural Resources to Industrial Development;</li>
<li>Contribution of Industries to the Environment; and</li>
<li>Extent to which changes in the environment due to business activities has affected social well-being.</li></ol>

<h2>Environmental Reporting can be classified into two parts</h2>
<p><b>(a) Management Note/Discussion in Director’s Report:</b> Broad Environment Protection Policy adopted and pursued by the Company and material proceedings under environmental laws should be disclosed here.<br>
<b>(b) Accounting Treatment and Reporting:</b> Financial effect of environmental protection measures on capital expenditures and earnings should be covered in the Notes forming part of Financial Statements.</p>

<h2>Reporting Requirements of Environmental Accounting</h2>
<p>Under a comprehensive Corporate Accounting Framework on environmental issues the Board of Directors in their Report or Management Discussions should disclose the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Type of environmental issues that are pertinent to the enterprise and its industry;</li>
<li>Policy and programmes that have been adopted by the Company with respect to Environmental Protection Measures; or where there is no policy or programmes, such fact should be disclosed;</li>
<li>Improvements made by the Company in key areas, since the introduction of the policy, or over the past five years, whichever is shorter;</li>
<li>Environmental Emission Targets that the Company has set for itself, and how the Company is performing relative to those targets;</li>
<li>Extent to which Environmental Protection Measures have been undertaken as per Government Legislation, and the extent to which Government Requirements (e.g. time table for reduction of emissions) are achieved;</li>
<li>Where any material proceedings under environmental laws have been taken, a disclosure of the known and potentially significant environmental problem shall be disclosed, unless it can be objectively concluded that the problem is not likely to occur, or if it does, the effect is not likely to be material;</li>
<li>Financial or Operational Effect of Environmental Protection Measures on the Capital Expenditure and Earnings of the Enterprise for the current period and any specific impact on future periods;</li>
<li>Actual Amount charged to operations in the current period, together with a description of the relative environmental measures.</li>
<li>Sub-classification of the above actual amounts into the following :
     <ol><li>Liquid Effluent Treatment;</li>
  <li>Waste Gas and Air Treatment;</li>
  <li>Solid Waste Treatment;</li>
  <li>Analysis Control and Compliance;</li>
  <li>Remediation;</li>
  <li>Recycling; and</li>
  <li>Others (e.g. accidents, safety, etc.).</li></ol>
Where it is not possible to segregate the amount that relates to Environmental Protection Measures, disclosure of such fact is essential.</li>
<li>When material, the actual amount capitalised during the current period, the accumulated amount capitalised to date, and the period for amortising, or writing off, such amounts, together with a description of the environmental measures to which they relate. This amount might be sub-divided into categories stated above. Where it is not possible to segregate the amount that relates to environmental measures, this fact could be stated.</li></ol>

<h2>Disclosure of environment-related Accounting Policies.</h2>
<p>The following environment-related Accounting Policies may be disclosed in the Notes to Accounts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Recording Liabilities and Provisions;</li>
<li>Setting up of Catastrophe Reserves (though appropriations of retained earnings);</li>
<li>Disclosure of Contingent Liabilities.</li></ol>
<br>
<p>The following environment-related items could be included in Contingent Liabilities, if material:</p>
<ol><li>Liabilities, Provisions and Reserves that have been set / made for the current period, and amounts accumulated to date,</li>
<li>Contingent Liabilities, with an estimate of the amount involved, unless the event is not likely to occur. Also, the possible loss could be quantified to the extent reasonably practicable. If the possible loss cannot be reasonably calculated, a description of the Contingent Liability could be given along with the reason why an estimate of the amount of the loss cannot be made. Completion of a feasibility study of remediation costs may be normally considered as the earliest date at which a reasonable estimate of the liability is possible.</li></ol>

<h2>Major issues in Environment Accounting.</h2>
<p>Major Accounting Issues in Environmental Accounting are: </p>
<ol>
<li><b>Environmental Expenditure vs. Normal Business Expenditure:</b> Many machines may have state-of-the-art environmental technology. Hence, a portion of such capital costs and also the running and maintenance expenditure may be treated as environment related expenditure. There should be proper guidelines for allocating the capital and revenue expenditures between Environmental Expenditure and Normal Business Expenditure.</li>
<li><b>Capitalisation vs. Charging Off of Environmental Expenditure:</b> Environmental protection costs relating to prior periods and current period are generally very high. If these are expensed off in one year, EPS may be adversely affected. Some Companies may capitalise such expenditure and amortise the same over say 10 years. Uniformity is required for comparative analysis of Financial Statements.</li>
<li><b>Recognition of Environment related Contingent Liabilities:</b> Environmental Contingent Liabilities are a matter of increasing concern. Recognizing a liability for hazardous waste remediation frequently depends on the ability to estimate remediation costs reasonably. Developing a reliable estimate requires evaluation of technological, regulatory and legal factors, each of which calls for exercise of management judgement to reach a supportable accounting conclusions.</li></ol>

<hr id="lease-accounting">
<h1>Lease Accounting</h1>

<h2>Meaning of Leasing</h2>
<p>Leasing involves a contractual relationship in which the owner (lessor) of an asset or property grants to a person/firm (lessee) the use of the asset's services for a specified period of time for an agreed sum of rent. Leasing therefore, enables a person/firm to avail the services of plant and machinery or equipment or land and building without making the investment or incurring debt obligation.<br>
For this kind of services, the person/firm can pay a series of periodic amounts called ‘lease rentals’ or ‘lease payments’ to the owner of the asset at predetermined rates. Such payments may be made monthly, quarterly or annually.</p>

<h2>Meaning of Lease</h2>
<p>Lease is an aggrement by which the lessor gives the right to use an asset for given period of time to the lessee on rent.<br>
It involves two parties, a lessor and a lessee and an asset which is to be leased. The lessor, who owns the asset, agrees to allow to the lessee to use it for a specified period of time in return for periodic rent payments.<br>
The lease transactions derive its accounting complexity from number of alternatives available to the parties involved. Lease can be structured to take tax benefit. It can be used to transfer ownership of the leased asset, and it can also be used to transfer the risk of ownership.<br>
In any event substance of transactions dictates the accounting treatment; the lease transaction (finance lease) is probably the best example of the accounting profession's substance over legal form.<br>
If the transactions effectively transfer ownership to lease, then the substance of the transactions is that of a sale and should be recognized as such even though transactions take form of a lease.</p>

<h2>Type of Lease</h2>
<p>As per Accounting Standard-19, the lease can be classified as:
<ol><li>Financial Lease</li>
<li>Operating Lease</li></ol>
</p>

<h2>1. Financial Lease</h2>
<p>A financial lease is a lease in which all the risks incidental to the ownership of the assets and rewards or benefits is transferred to the lessee, except the title which may or may not eventually be transferred. Finance lease ia also called as capital lease. Leasing under this type of contract is irrevocable or non-cancellable. Lessor is mere a financier and not interested in the asset. The lessor can recover his capital outlays and a reasonable return on his investment in the asset during the term of lease. The cost towards insurance, taxes, repairs and maintenance are borne by the lessee.</p>

<h2>Criteria for Financial Lease</h2>
<p>A question arises as what are the criteria which would lead to a lease being classified as financial lease. AS-19 provides certain criteria which would normally lead to a lease being classified as a financial lease. These are:
<ol>
<li>Lessor transfers ownership of the asset to the lessee by the end of lease term.</li>
<li>Lessee has the option to purchase the asset at a price which is expected to be quite lower than the fair value at the date, the option becomes exercisable such that at the time of inception of the lease, it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised.</li>
<li>Lease-term is for major part of the economic life of the asset, even if the title is not transferred.</li>
<li>At the inception of the lease the present value (calculated by using the appropriate discounting rate) of Minimum Lease Payments (MLP) amounts to at least substantially all of the fair value of the leased asset.</li>
<li>The leased asset is of such a specialised nature that only the lessee can use it without major modifications being made.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h2>2. Operating Lease</h2>
<p>As per AS-19, operating lease which does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incident to ownership. In other words, a lease other than a financial lease is an operating lease. The operating lease have the following features:
<ol>
<li>The lease can be cancelled by the lessor before the expiry period.</li>
<li>The responsibility for providing maintenance and repairs, insurance and services lies with the lessor.</li>
<li>The rental paid by the lessee may not be necessarily sufficient to cover the asset's cost.</li>
<li>The lease period is of a shorter duration.</li>
<li>The asset is returned to the lessor after the expiry of the lease period who can sell the asset to recover the cost of asset.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h2>Distinction between Financial Lease and Operating Lease</h2>
<table>
<tr><th>Financial Lease</th>
<th>Operating Lease</th></tr>

<tr><td>The leased asset is use specific. The lessor generally purchases the asset identified and lease out to lessee.</td>
<td>The leased based asset is of common use activity. The lessor already has the possession of the asset and leases it out to several users successively.</td></tr>

<tr><td>The lease period is longer i.e., usually related to the useful life of the asset.</td>

<h2>3. Sale and Leaseback</h2>
<p>In this type of lease, the owner of an asset sells that asset to the lessor and then gets the asset back on lease from the lessor. The purpose of the leaseback is to free up the original owner's capital while allowing the owner to retain possession and use of the property.<br>
<br>
A sale and leaseback can be beneficial to both the buyer as well as the seller. The seller gets a lumpsum of cash quickly which improves the liquidity. And the lessor gets the benefit in terms of tax credit and a flow of regular income.<br>
<br>
The sale and leaseback aggrement is popular among companies which are facing short-term liquidity crisis. Oil and Natural Gas Commission (ONGC), undertook an international ‘sale and leaseback’ aggrement with 10 Japanese lessors, led by Sumisho Leasing for an equipment owned by the ONGC, aggregating $60 million. The payment terms were fixed at a rate of 10.5% with the amount payable in 14 equal semi-annual installments, following a grace period of 6 years, so that the aggregate lease tenor extended to 13 years. The ONGC simultaneously swapped the fixed-rate borrowing with a floating-interest rate so that the cost of funds was reduced to 60 basis points below Libor.</p>

<h2>4. Leverage Leasing</h4>
<p>Under leveraged-leasing aggrement, a third party is involved besides the lessor and the lessee. The lessor borrows a part of the purchase cost (say 80%) of the asset from the third party, that is, the lender and the asset so purchased is held as a security against the loan. The lender is paid off from the lease rentals directly by the lessee and the surplus after meeting the claims of the  lender goes to the lessor. The lessor, the owner of the asset, is entitled to a depreciation allowance, associated with the asset.</p>

<h2>5. Close- and Open-ended Lease</h2>
<p>In a close-ended lease, the asset gets transferred to the lessor, at the end of the lease-contract period, where as in an open-ended lease, the lessee has the option of purchasing the asset.</p>

<h2>6. Upfront and Back-end Lease</h2>
<p>In an upfront lease, higher lease rentals are charged in the initial years and lower rentals in the later years of contract. Where as in the back-end lease, in the initial years, the lease rentals are less but increase in the later years.</p>

<h2>7. Percentage Lease</h2>
<p>In the percentage lease, the lessor needs to pay fix-lease rentals plus some percentage of the previous year's gross revenue.</p>

<h2>8. 3N Lease (Net and Net-net Leases)</h2>
<p>In the Net and Net-net leases, the lessee is responsible for maintenance, insurance and taxes of the property.</p>

<h2>9. Cross-border Lease</h2>
<p>In the cross-border or international lease, the lessee and the lessor are situated in two different countries.</p>

<h2>Contents of Lease Contract</h2>
<ol><li>The period of lease.</li>
<li>The amount and time of payment to be paid by the lessee.</li>
<li>Provision for payment of tax, insurance, repairs and maintenance.</li>
<li>Renewal of lease or purchase of assets on the expiration of lease.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Advantages of Leasing</h2>
<p>The advantages of leasing are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Leasing agreement provides acquisition of fixed assets without outlaying any capital expenditure and the period of lease and rent can be changed or fixed by mutual agreement.</li>
<li>Leasing aggrement provides the lessee an opportunity to use its internal resources for financing and other activities.</li>
<li>Lease provides tax benefit deduction to lessee and leasing does not effect the maximum borrowing limits.</li>
<li>Leasing aggrement does not affect the financial position of the company as it does not form a part of liabilities or assets to be shown in Balance Sheet.</li>
<li>Leasing is considered as an additional source of finance and does not involve any cost in raising capital.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Shortcomings of Leasing</h2>
<p>The shortcomings of leasing are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Leasing aggrement provides the payment of rent immediately after entering the aggrement i.e., even before the cash being generated from those activities.</li>
<li>Leasing may restrict certain tax incentives/benefits which are being provided by the tax authorities for new projects.</li>
<li>The rent and interest rates can be changed under various clauses of lease agreement which may become burden for lessee after few years of lease.</li>
<li>The lessee can not terminate the contract except by paying penalties which may be very heavier.</li>
<li>The lessee can review the lease after the expiry of the term only if he has the right to do so.</li>

<h1>Accounting for Financial Instruments</h1>

<h2>Meaning of Financial Instruments</h2>
<p>A financial instruments is a legally enforceable aggrement between two or more parties expressing contractual rights to the payment of money. It is a contractual right of one person to the aggrement and contractual liability of another person to the aggrement, consequently it will be the financial asset for the person who has right to receive the money and financial liability for the person who has obligation to pay money. Thus the financial instrument includes financial asset as well as financial liability. This is the reason why these accounting standards on financial instruments are not merely relevant to financial entities but equally to non-financial entities.<br>
<br>
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a ‘financial asset’ of one entity and a ‘financial liability’ or equity instrument of another entity.</p>

<h2>Financial Asset</h2>
<p>Any asset that is:</p>
<ol><li>Cash;</li>
<li>An equity instrument of another entity;</li>
<li>A contractual right:
  <ol><li>To receive cash or another financial asset from another entity; or</li>
  <li>To exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another entity under conditions those are potentially favourable to the entity.</li>
  </ol></li>
<li>A contract that will or may be settled in the entity's own equity instruments that is:
  <ol><li>A non-derivative for which the entity is or may be obliged to receive a variable number of the entity's own equity instrument; or</li>
  <li>A derivative that will or may be settled other than by the exchange of a fixed amount of cash or another financial asset for a fixed number of the entity's own equity instruments.</li>
  </ol></li>
</ol>

<h2>Common examples of financial assets:</h2>
<p>Representing a contractual right to receive cash in the future are:</p>
<ol><li>Trade accounts receivable</li>
<li>Notes receivable</li>
<li>Loans receivable and</li>
<li>Bonds receivable</li>
</ol>

<h2>Assets which are not a financial assets:</h2>
<ol><li>Physical assets such as inventories, property, plant and equipment;
</li>
<li>Leased assets;</li>
<li>Intangible assets such as patents and trademarks are not financial assets;</li>
<li>Prepaid expenses;</li>
<li>Income tax refund.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Financial Liability</h2>
<p>Any liability that is a contractual obligation to:</p>
<ol><li>Deliver cash or another financial asset to another entity; or</li>
<li>Exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another entity under conditions that are potentially favourable to the entity.</li></ol>

<h2>Examples of financial liability:</h2>
<ol><li>Trade payable - Contractual obligation to pay cash</li>
<li>Bank loans - Contractual obligation to pay cash</li>
<li>Finance lease obligation</li>
<li>Operating lease rent payable</li>
<li>Debentures and Bonds payable</li>
<li>Financial guarantee</li>
<li>Financial derivatives</li>
<li>Redeemable preference share capital</li>
</ol>

<h2>Examples of items which are not financial liability:</h2>
<ol><li>Income tax payable</li>
<li>Excise duty payable</li>
<li>VAT payable</li>
<li>Provision for warranty obligation - To be settled by providing goods or services and not by cash</li>
<li>Advances from customers - To be settled by providing goods or services</li>
<li>Minority interest</li>
<li>Non-financial contact</li>
<li>Non-financial derivative's contact</li></ol>

<h2>Redeemable Preference Share</h2>
<p>The substance of a financial instrument, rather than its legal form, governs its classification in the entity's Balance Sheet. Substance and legal form are commonly consistent, but not always. Some financial instruments take the legal form of equity but are liabilities in substance and others may combine features associated with equity instruments and features associated with financial liabilities.</p>

<h2>Puttable Instrument</h2>
<p>A Puttable Instrument is a financial instrument that gives the holder the right to put the instrument back to the issuer for cash or another financial asset or is automatically put back to the issuer on the occurrence of an uncertain future event or the death or retirement of the instrument holder.</p>

<h2>Equity Instrument</h2>
<p>An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. In simple terms, an equity instrument of Company X gives a person a share of the equity of Company X.</p>

<h2>Examples of Equity Instruments</h2>
<ol><li>Non-puttable Ordinary Shares</li>
<li>Puttable Instruments (if not financial liabilities and specific conditions are met)</li>
<li>Instruments imposing obligation to deliver pro-rata share in net assets only on liquidation (if not financial liabilities and specific conditions are met)</li>
<li>Preference Shares (when distribution is at the discretion of the issuer and not mandatory)</li>
<li>Warrants or Written call options.</li></ol>

<h2>Preference shares</h2>
<p>Preference shares may be issued with various rights. In determining whether a preference share is a financial liability or an equity instrument, an issuer assesses the particular rights attaching to the share to determine whether it exhibits the fundamental characteristics of a financial liability.</p>


<h2>Disclosure Requirements for Financial Instruments</h2>
<p>Ind AS-107 prescribes the disclosure requirements for:</p>
<ol><li>Different categories of financial assets</li>
<li>Different categories of financial liabilities</li>
<li>Re-classifications of financial assets</li>
<li>De-recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities</li>
<li>Financial assets pledged or held as collateral</li>
<li>Allowances for credit losses</li>
<li>Compound financial instruments with multiple embedded derivatives</li>
<li>Defaults and breaches for loan payable</li>
<li>Income, expense, gains or losses recognized in profit and loss account</li>
<li>Accounting policies followed</li>
<li>Hedge accounting</li>
<li>Fair value determination for financial assets and financial liabilities</li>
<li>Risk disclosures.</li></ol>

<h2>Types of Financial Assets</h2>
<p>The financial assets may be of three types:</p>
<ol><li>Debt Instrument</li>
<li>Equity Instrument</li>
<li>Derivatives</li></ol>

<h2>Classification of Financial Liabilities</h2>
<p>A financial liability is classified into two categories as under:</p>
<ol><li>Financial liabilities at amortized cost</li>
<li>Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)</li></ol>


<hr id="stock-options">
<h1>Stock Options</h1>

<h2>Meaning of Stock Options</h2>
<p>A stock option is a financial instrument that allows the option handler the right to buy or sell shares of a certain stock at a specified price for a specified period of time.<br>
<br>
Stock options are traded on exchanges much like the stocks (Apple, ExxonMobil, etc.) themselves. The price of the option itself can be higher or lower than the original price when it was first listed. Most listed options in the U.S. conform to an options calendar and typically expire on the third friday of the month in which they are set to expire. Prior to this expiration date,  the option holder has to decide whether to exercise the option by buying or selling the number of shares associated with the option, selling the option, or simply letting it expire.</p>

<h2>Here are a few key terms associated with options:</h2>
<ol><li>A call option allows the option holder the right to purchase the stock at a set price within a set time.</li>
<li>A put option allows the buyer the option to sell shares of the stock at a set price within a set period of time.</li>
<li>The strike price is the price at which the option can be exercised.</li>
<li>A premium is the amount the buyer of the option pays for the option. It represents the maximum profit the seller of the option can realize.</li></ol>

<h2>How do Stock Options work?</h2>
<p>The price of a listed option is tied to the price movement of the underlying stock. If the price of the stock rises or falls, the option will generally move in the same direction.</p>

<h2>Employee Stock Options (ESOs)</h2>
<p>In addition to listed stock options, a number of companies offer employee stock options as a form of incentive compensation. Employee stock options offer the employee the right to purchase a set number of shares at a specified price for a fixed period of time.</p>


<hr id="eps">
<h1>Earnings Per Share (EPS)</h1>

<h2>Meaning of Earnings Per Share (EPS)</h2>
<p>Earnings per share are the net earnings of the company earned on one share. It is an important and widely used metric which audited financial reports of the companies also particularly mentions in most countries. In other words, it expresses the earning capacity of the company, if divided by the value of one share. We commonly call it return on equity. Higher the EPS, the better is the performance and prospects of the company. The track record of EPS for several years reflects the growth rate of the company and potential investors look forward to investing in the company if they see an increasing trend.</p>


<h2>Formula for Calculating Earnings per Share</h2>
<p>The equation or formula used for earnings per share ratio is as follows:</p>


<img src="img-eps.jpg" alt="eps">

Earnings Per Share = 

Profits / Earnings after Taxes (EAT) Less Preference Share Dividend

___________________________________

Number of Equity Shares Outstanding


<p>We commonly call it ‘return on equity’. The track record of EPS for several years reflect the growth rate of the company and potential investors look forward to investing in the company if they see an increasing trend.</p>


<hr id="reporting">
<h1>Reporting</h1>

<h2>Meaning of Financial Reporting</h2>
<p>Financial reporting may be defined as communication of published financial statements and related information from a business enterprise to third parties (external users) including shareholders, creditors, customers, governmental authorities and the public. It is the reporting of accounting information of an entity (individual, firm, company, government enterprise) to a user or group of users. Company financial reporting is a total communication system involving the company as issuer (preparer); the investors and creditors as primary users, other external users; the accounting profession as measures and auditors; and the company law regulatory or administrative authorities.</p>

<h2>Objectives of Financial Reporting</h2>
<p>The following may be described as the primary objectives of financial reporting:</p>
<ol><li>Investment Decision-making</li>
<li>Management Accountability</li></ol>

<h2>Investment Decision-making</h2>
<p>The basic objective of financial reporting is to provide information useful to investors, creditors and other users in making sound investment decisions. These decisions concern the efficient allocation of investment funds and the selection among investment opportunities.</p>

<h2>Management Accountability</h2>
<p>A second basic objective of financial reporting is to provide information on management accountability to judge management's effectiveness in utilising the resources and running the enterprise. Management of an enterprise is periodically accountable to the owners not only for the custody and safekeeping of enterprise resources, but also for their efficient and profitable use and for protecting them to the extent possible from unfavourable economic impacts of factors in the economy such as technological changes, inflation or deflation.</p>


<hr id="securitization">
<h1>Securitization of Assets</h1>

<h2>Meaning of Securitization</h2>
<p>Securitization is a carefully structured process by which a pool of loans and other receivables are packaged and sold in the form of asset-backed securities to the investors to raise the required funds from them. Through this process relatively illiquid assets are converted into securities. Securitization falls under the broad category termed as structured finance transactions.<br>
<br>
In a securitized transaction, the burden of repayment on the bond shifts away from the issuer to a pool of assets or to a third party. The cash flows from the pools of assets which have been securitized provide the funds for repayment to the bond.<br>
<br>
Securitization is said to have taken place when a company’s assets are removed in one way or the other form from its balance sheet and are funded instead by investors. The investors receive tradable financial instruments evidencing the investment without recourse to lending institution. The entire transaction, from the accounting point of view, is carried out on the asset side of the balance sheet, that is, one asset gets converted into another.</p>

<h2>Mechanism of Securitization</h2>
<p>Typically, the mechanism of securitization is outlined below:</p>
<ol>
<li>The process of securitization starts with identification by the company (the originator) the loans or bills receivable in its portfolio, to prepare a basket or pool of assets to be securitized. The package usually forms an optimum mix so as to ensure fair marketability of the instrument to be issued.</li>

<li>The pool of assets so identified is then sold to a specific purpose vehicle (SPV) or trust. Usually an investment banker performs the task of an SPV, which is also called an issuer, as it ultimately issues the securities to investors.</li>

<li>Once the assets are acquired by SPV, the same are split into individual shares/securities which are reimbursed by selling them to investors. These securities are called ‘Pay or Pass Through Certificates’ (PTC) which are so structured as to synchronize for redemption with the maturity of the securitized loans or bills.<br>
<br>
A PTC thus represents a sale of an undivided interest to the extent of the face value of the PTC in the aggregate pool of assets acquired by the SPV from the originator.</li>

<li>Repayments under the securitized loans or bills keep on being received by the originator and passed on to the SPV. To this end, the contractual relationship between the originator an d the borrowers/obligates is allowed to subsist in terms of the pass through transaction; alternatively a separate agency arrangement is made between the SPV (Principal) and the originator (agent).</li>

<li>Although a PTC could be with recourse to its originator, the usual practice has been to make it without recourse. Accordingly, a PTC holder takes recourse to the SPV and not the originator for payment to the principal and interest on the PTCs held by him. However, a part of the credit risk, as perceived (and not interest risk), can be absorbed by the originator, by transferring the assets at a discount, enabling the SPV to issue the PTCs at a discount to face value.</li>

<li>The debt to be securitized and the PTC issues are got rated by rating agencies on the eve of the securitization. The issues by the SPV could also be guaranteed by external guarantor-institutions to enhance creditability of the issues. The PTCs, before maturity, are tradable in a secondary market to ensure liquidity for the investors.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<p>From the above, it is evident that the primary participants involved in the issuance of securitization transaction are the originator, obligors, the SPV, the servicer and the credit enhancer. The originator has the assets which are sold or used as collateral for the assets backed securities. Originators are generally manufacturing companies, financial institutions, banks and non-banking finance companies.</p>

<h2>Utility of Securitization</h2>
<p>Securitization as a financial instrument is becoming extremely popular the world over with more and more issuers resorting to raising funds through this route. This is for this fact that it confers lot of benefits on the parties to the process.<br>
<br>
Securitization serves as handmade to organization in raising additional funds to finance their growth programme. Companies with poor credit standing and therefore finding it difficult to procure resources from the market can obtain funds by issuing asset back securities at lower interest cost due to higher credit rating on such securities. Even if the issuer is not an AAA rated company, it can issue an AAA rated securitized asset.<br>
<br>
Further, cost of raising funds by way of securitization is cheaper than that involved in funding by way of conventional fund-raising instruments like shares, bonds, debentures, and commercial papers.<br>
<br>
Securitization also facilitates strengthening of capital adequacy of the originating company by isolating the loan-assets from the originator’s balance sheet and by removing or replacing them. Securitization is equally useful to investors. It offers multiple new investment instruments for mutual funds, insurance companies, pension funds and general investors to cater to their needs and preferences. Besides widening the choice and availability, it also provides for higher return and liquidity for the instrument.</p>
